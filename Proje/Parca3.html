<p class=MsoNormal>He thought that it would be well to open it, and that this
package might possibly contain the address of the young girls, if it really
belonged to them, and, in any case, the information necessary to a restitution
to the person who had lost it. He opened the envelope. It was not sealed and
contained four letters, also unsealed. They bore addresses. All four exhaled a
horrible odor of tobacco. The first was addressed To Madame, Madame la Marquise
de Grucheray, the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No. Marius said to
himself, that he should probably find in it the information which he sought,
and that, moreover, the letter being open, it was probable that it could be
read without impropriety. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1247 It was conceived
as follows Madame la Marquise The virtue of clemency and piety is that which
most closely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look of
compassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the
sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood, consecrated his
fortune, evverything, to defend that cause, and to-day finds himself in the
greatest missery. He doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to
preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and
honor full of wounds, counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and
on the interest which Madame la Marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate.
Their prayer will not be in vain, and their gratitude will preserve theirs
charming souvenir. My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be
Madame, Don Alvares, Spanish Captain of Cavalry, a royalist who has take refuge
in France, who finds himself on travells for his country, and the resources are
lacking him to continue his travells. No address was joined to the signature.
Marius hoped to find the address in the second letter, whose superscription
read A Madame, Madame la Comtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9. This is
what Marius read in it Madame la Comtesse It is an unhappy mother of a fam-
1248 Les Miserables ily of six children the last of which is only eight months
old. I sick since my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago,
haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance. In the hope of
Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be, Madame, with profound respect,
Mistress Balizard. Marius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like
the preceding he read Monsieur Pabourgeot, Elector, wholesale stocking
merchant, Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers. I permit myself to
address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your
simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a
drama to the Theatre-Francais. The subject is historical, and the action takes
place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire the style, I think, is natural,
laconic, and may have some merit. There are couplets to be sung in four places.
The comic, the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters,
and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which
proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations, in the midst of
many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes. My principal object is to satisfi
the desire which progressively animates the man of our century, that is to say,
the fashion, that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost
every new wind. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1249 In spite of these
qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, the egotism of priviliged
authors, may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre, for I am not ignorant of
the mortifications with which new-comers are treated. Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your
just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to
send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you, lacking
bread and fire in this wynter season. When I say to you that I beg you to
accept the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all
those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have
the honor of sheltering myself under your protection, and of adorning my
writings with your name. If you deign to honor me with the most modest
offering, I shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay
you my tribute of gratitude. Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as
perfect as possible, will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning
of the drama and delivered on the stage. To Monsieur and Madame Pabourgeot, My
most respectful complements, Genflot, man of letters. P. S. Even if it is only
forty sous. Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself, but
sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me, alas! to go out.
Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran To the benevolent
Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-haut-Pas. It contained the following
1250 Les Miserables lines Benevolent Man If you deign to accompany my daughter,
you will behold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates. At
the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment
of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers always feel lively emotions.
Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need,
and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining a little relief, to get
oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and
to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved. Destinies are
very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others. I await
your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one, and I beseech you to
accept the respectful sentiments with which I have the honor to be, truly
magnanimous man, your very humble and very obedient servant, P. Fabantou,
dramatic artist. After perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself
much further advanced than before. In the first place, not one of the signers
gave his address. Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals,
Don Alveras, Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou
but the singular thing about these letters was, that all four were written by
the same hand. What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1251 they all come from the same person? Moreover,
and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the coarse and yellow
paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco was the same, and, although
an attempt had been made to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were
reproduced with the greatest tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was
no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain. It was waste of trouble to
try to solve this petty mystery. Had it not been a chance find, it would have
borne the air of a mystification. Marius was too melancholy to take even a
chance pleasantry well, and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the
street seemed desirous of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was
playing the part of the blind man in blind mans buff between the four letters,
and that they were making sport of him. Nothing, however, indicated that these
letters belonged to the two young girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard.
After all, they were evidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in
their envelope, flung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven
oclock in the morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to
settle down to work, when there came a soft knock at his door. As he owned
nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally, though very rarely,
when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even when absent he left his key in
the lock. You will be robbed, said Maam Bougon. Of what? said Marius. The truth
is, however, that he had, one day, 1252 Les Miserables been robbed of an old
pair of boots, to the great triumph of Maam Bougon. There came a second knock,
as gentle as the first. Come in, said Marius. The door opened. What do you
want, Maam Bougon? asked Marius, without raising his eyes from the books and
manuscripts on his table. A voice which did not belong to Maam Bougon replied
Excuse me, sir It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an
old man, roughened with brandy and liquor. Marius turned round hastily, and
beheld a young girl. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1253 CHAPTER IV A ROSE IN
MISERY A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window
of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door,
and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated,
slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that
chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a
string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic
pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth,
missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has
missed her youth, and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with
fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause
those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep. Marius had risen, and was
staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who was almost like the forms of the
shadows which traverse dreams. The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that
this young girl had not come into the world to be homely. In her early 1254 Les
Miserables childhood she must even have been pretty. The grace of her age was still
struggling against the hideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and
poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like
the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a
winters day. That face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he
remembered having seen it somewhere. What do you wish, Mademoiselle? he asked.
The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict Here is a letter for
you, Monsieur Marius. She called Marius by his name he could not doubt that he
was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl? How did she know his
name? Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered
resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed, at the
whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes in her petticoat
permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees. She was shivering. She
held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius. Marius, as he opened
the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist.
The message could not have come from a distance. He read My amiable neighbor,
young man I have learned of your goodness to me, that you paid my rent six
months ago. I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter will tell you that Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1255 we have been without a morsel of bread for two
days, four persons and my spouse ill. If I am not deseaved in my opinion, I
think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the
desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a
slight favor. I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the
benefactors of humanity, Jondrette. P.S. My eldest daughter will await your
orders, dear Monsieur Marius. This letter, coming in the very midst of the
mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius thoughts ever since the
preceding evening, was like a candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.
This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same
writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of
tobacco. There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a
single signer. The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,
the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named
Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette. Marius had lived
in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, as we have said, but
very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean
neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are
also. He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor
or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to
them, 1256 Les Miserables that, on the preceding evening, he had jostled the
Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, for it had
evidently been they, and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just
entered his room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague
recollection of having met her elsewhere. Now he saw everything clearly. He
understood that his neighbor Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry
of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons, that he procured
addresses, and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be
wealthy and compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk
and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his
daughters he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the stake.
Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the evening
before, from their breathless condition, from their terror and from the words
of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying some
inexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole was, in the midst
of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable beings who were
neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by
misery. Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor
evil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood, have
already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor responsibility.
Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers
let fall in the streets, which are soiled with Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1257 every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.
Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young
girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre.
She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her nakedness. Occasionally
her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to her waist. She moved the
chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode,
she handled Marius clothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the
corners. Hullo! said she, you have a mirror! And she hummed scraps of
vaudevilles, as though she had been alone, frolicsome refrains which her hoarse
and guttural voice rendered lugubrious. An indescribable constraint, weariness,
and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a
disgrace. Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the
room, and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened
by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other
conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this young
girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never, even among animals, does
the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. That is only to be seen
among men. Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way. She approached
the table. Ah! said she, books! A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed,
and her ac- 1258 Les Miserables cent expressed the happiness which she felt in
boasting of something, to which no human creature is insensible I know how to
read, I do! She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read
with tolerable fluency General Bauduin received orders to take the chateau of
Hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five
battalions of his brigade. She paused. Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was
a battle long ago. My father was there. My father has served in the armies. We
are fine Bonapartists in our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the
English. She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed And I know how
to write, too! She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius Do you want
to see? Look here, Im going to write a word to show you. And before he had time
to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper, which lay in the middle of the
table The bobbies are here. Then throwing down the pen There are no faults of
orthography. You can look. We have received an education, my sister and I. We
have not always been as we are now. We were not made Here she paused, fixed her
dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing, saying, with an intonation which
contained every form of anguish, stifled by every form of cynicism Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1259 Bah! And she began to hum these words to a gay air Jai
faim, mon pere. I am hungry, father. Pas de fricot. I have no food. Jai froid,
ma mere. I am cold, mother. Pas de tricot. I have no clothes. Grelotte,
Lolotte! Lolotte! Shiver, Sanglote, Sob, Jacquot! Jacquot! She had hardly
finished this couplet, when she exexclaimed Do you ever go to the play,
Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little brother who is a friend of the artists,
and who gives me tickets sometimes. But I dont like the benches in the
galleries. One is cramped and uncomfortable there. There are rough people there
sometimes and people who smell bad. Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a
singular air and said Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome
fellow? And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made
her smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on his
shoulder You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet you here on
the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person 1260 Les Miserables
named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when I
have been strolling in that quarter. It is very becoming to you to have your
hair tumbled thus. She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in
making it very deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx
to her lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing. Marius had
retreated gently. Mademoiselle, said he, with his cool gravity, I have here a
package which belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you. And he
held out the envelope containing the four letters. She clapped her hands and
exclaimed We have been looking everywhere for that! Then she eagerly seized the
package and opened the envelope, saying as she did so Dieu de Dieu! how my
sister and I have hunted! And it was you who found it! On the boulevard, was it
not? It must have been on the boulevard? You see, we let it fall when we were
running. It was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid. When we got
home, we could not find it anywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that
is useless, as that is entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we said
that we had carried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said
to us Nix. So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find out that
they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that we jostled as we
passed last night. We couldnt see. I said to my sister Is it a gentle- Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1261 man? My sister said to me I think it is a
gentleman. In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the
benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas. Here! said she,
this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the way, this is his hour. Ill
go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on. Then
she began to laugh again, and added Do you know what it will mean if we get a
breakfast today? It will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day
before yesterday, our breakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that
at once, and this morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs,
burst! This reminded Marius of the wretched girls errand to himself. He fumbled
in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there. The young girl went on, and
seemed to have no consciousness of Marius presence. I often go off in the
evening. Sometimes I dont come home again. Last winter, before we came here, we
lived under the arches of the bridges. We huddled together to keep from
freezing. My little sister cried. How melancholy the water is! When I thought
of drowning myself, I said to myself No, its too cold. I go out alone, whenever
I choose, I sometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk
along the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and as
big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say to myself
Why, theres water there! The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, one
1262 Les Miserables would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out,
I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is
night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I dont know what all. I
think people are flinging stones at me, I flee without knowing whither,
everything whirls and whirls. You feel very queer when you have had no food.
And then she stared at him with a bewildered air. By dint of searching and
ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous.
This was all he owned in the world for the moment. At all events, he thought,
there is my dinner for to-day, and to-morrow we will see. He kept the sixteen
sous, and handed the five francs to the young girl. She seized the coin. Good!
said she, the sun is shining! And, as though the sun had possessed the property
of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain, she went on Five francs! the
shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Aint this fine! Youre a jolly thief! Im your
humble servant! Bravo for the good fellows! Two days wine! and meat! and stew!
well have a royal feast! and a good fill! She pulled her chemise up on her
shoulders, made a low bow to Marius, then a familiar sign with her hand, and
went towards the door, saying Good morning, sir. Its all right. Ill go and find
my old man. As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1263 on the commode, which was moulding there amid the dust
she flung herself upon it and bit into it, muttering Thats good! its hard! it
breaks my teeth! Then she departed. 1264 Les Miserables CHAPTER V A PROVIDENTIAL
PEEP-HOLE Marius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in
distress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True misery
he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just passed before
his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing
the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of
woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child. When a man has
reached his last extremity, he has reached his last resources at the same time.
Woe to the defenceless beings who surround him! Work, wages, bread, fire,
courage, good will, all fail him simultaneously. The light of day seems
extinguished without, the moral light within in these shadows man encounters
the feebleness of the woman and the child, and bends them violently to
ignominy. Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile
partitions which all open on either vice or Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1265 crime. Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the
heart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated in
sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which encounters
opprobrium, and which accomodates itself to it. Fathers, mothers, children,
brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere and become incorporated,
almost like a mineral formation, in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes,
relationships, ages, infamies, and innocences. They crouch, back to back, in a
sort of hut of fate. They exchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate
wretches! How pale they are! How cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt
in a planet much further from the sun than ours. This young girl was to Marius
a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows. She revealed to him a
hideous side of the night. Marius almost reproached himself for the
preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance
on his neighbors up to that day. The payment of their rent had been a
mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to but he, Marius, should
have done better than that. What! only a wall separated him from those
abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest
of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last
link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather,
rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day,
every instant, he heard them walking on the other 1266 Les Miserables side of
the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an
ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his
thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves
in the air, to follies and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in
Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! He
even formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had
had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary
and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their
signals of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken
hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt,
very vile, very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are
rare besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and
are confounded in a single word, a fatal word, the miserable whose fault is
this? And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion
as the fall is great? While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were
occasions on which Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue
and scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which
separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze,
full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people. The wall
was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the reader had
just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly
distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive
this Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1267 long before. There was no paper
pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius
the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the
partition, almost unconsciously sometimes revery examines, observes, and
scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up he had just perceived,
near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the
space between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity
was missing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this
aperture into the Jondrettes attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its
curiosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze
at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.27 27 The peep-hole is a
Judas in French. Hence the halfpunning allusion. Let us get some little idea of
what these people are like, thought Marius, and in what condition they are. He
climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked. 1268 Les
Miserables CHAPTER VI THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR Cities, like forests, have their
caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they
contain conceal themselves. Only, in cities, that which thus conceals itself is
ferocious, unclean, and petty, that is to say, ugly in forests, that which
conceals itself is ferocious, savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful.
Taking one lair with another, the beasts is preferable to the mans. Caverns are
better than hovels. What Marius now beheld was a hovel. Marius was poor, and
his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his poverty was noble, his garret was
neat. The den upon which his eye now rested was abject, dirty, fetid,
pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only furniture consisted of a straw chair, an
infirm table, some old bits of crockery, and in two of the corners, two
indescribable pallets all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four
panes, draped with spiders webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just
enough light to make the face of a man appear like Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1269 the face of a phantom. The walls had a leprous aspect, and were
covered with seams and scars, like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady
a repulsive moisture exuded from them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with
charcoal could be distinguished upon them. The chamber which Marius occupied
had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor planked its
inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had
grown black under the long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor,
where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but one
virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old
shoes, socks, and repulsive rags however, this room had a fireplace, so it was
let for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thing in that fireplace, a
brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes,
and even a little fire. Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.
One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that it was
large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of roofs,
bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nooks where it seemed as
though spiders as big as ones fist, wood-lice as large as ones foot, and
perhaps evenwho knows? some monstrous human beings, must be hiding. One of the
pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One end of each touched
the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperture through which
Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was 1270 Les Miserables
suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was the
inscription THE DREAM. This represented a sleeping woman, and a child, also
asleep, the child on the womans lap, an eagle in a cloud, with a crown in his
beak, and the woman thrusting the crown away from the childs head, without
awaking the latter in the background, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue
column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription MARINGO
AUSTERLITS IENA WAGRAMME ELOT Beneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which
was no longer than it was broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping
attitude against the wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face
turned to the wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of
some pier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to
be rehung. Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper,
sat a man about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a
cunning, cruel, and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel. If Lavater had studied this
visage, he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there, the bird
of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1271 and complementing each other the pettifogger making
the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible.
This man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a womans chemise, which allowed
his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair, to be seen.
Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected
were visible. He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in
the hovel, but there was still tobacco. He was writing probably some more
letters like those which Marius had read. On the corner of the table lay an
ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume, and the size, which was the antique 12mo
of reading-rooms, betrayed a romance. On the cover sprawled the following
title, printed in large capitals GOD THE KING HONOR AND THE LADIES BY DUCRAY
DUMINIL, 1814. As the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words
The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look at Pere
Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the acacia alley,
which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. The little people, the poor,
the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put down below, where the mud is up
to your knees, in the damp places. They are put there so that they will decay
the sooner! You cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth. He
paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he 1272 Les Miserables
ground his teeth Oh! I could eat the whole world! A big woman, who might be
forty years of age, or a hundred, was crouching near the fireplace on her bare
heels. She, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched
with bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of her
petticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it could be
seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort of giant, beside her
husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blond which was turning gray, and
which she thrust back from time to time, with her enormous shining hands, with
their flat nails. Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same
form as the other, and probably a volume of the same romance. On one of the
pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl, who sat
there half naked and with pendant feet, and who did not seem to be listening or
seeing or living. No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his
room. She seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny it was
evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had said, on the
boulevard the evening before I bolted, bolted, bolted! She was of that puny
sort which remains backward for a long time, then suddenly starts up rapidly.
It is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants. These creatures
have neither childhood nor youth. At fifteen years Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1273 of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they seem twenty.
To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might say that they stride through
life, in order to get through with it the more speedily. At this moment, this
being had the air of a child. Moreover, no trace of work was revealed in that
dwelling no handicraft, no spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some
ironmongery of dubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows
despair and precedes the death agony. Marius gazed for a while at this gloomy
interior, more terrifying than the interior of a tomb, for the human soul could
be felt fluttering there, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the
cellar, the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very
bottom of the social edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its
antechamber but, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the
entrance of their palaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side by
side with them, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule. The man held
his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did not even seem to
breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was audible. The man grumbled,
without pausing in his writing. Canaille! canaille! everybody is canaille! This
variation to Solomons exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman. Calm
yourself, my little friend, she said. Dont hurt yourself, my dear. You are too
good to write to all those 1274 Les Miserables people, husband. Bodies press
close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts draw apart. This woman
must have loved this man, to all appearance, judging from the amount of love
within her but probably, in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible
distress which weighed on the whole group, this had become extinct. There no
longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her
husband. Nevertheless, caressing appellations had survived, as is often the
case. She called him My dear, my little friend, my good man, etc., with her
mouth while her heart was silent. The man resumed his writing. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1275 CHAPTER VII STRATEGY AND TACTICS Marius, with a load upon
his breast, was on the point of descending from the species of observatory
which he had improvised, when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to
remain at his post. The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The
eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large,
coarse, mens shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red
ankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters. Marius had
not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had probably deposited it at his
door, in order that she might inspire the more pity, and had picked it up again
on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to behind her, paused to take breath,
for she was completely breathless, then exclaimed with an expression of triumph
and joy He is coming! The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned
her head, the little sister did not stir. Who? demanded her father. The
gentleman! 1276 Les Miserables The philanthropist? Yes. From the church of
Saint-Jacques? Yes. That old fellow? Yes. And he is coming? He is following me.
You are sure? I am sure. There, truly, he is coming? He is coming in a fiacre.
In a fiacre. He is Rothschild. The father rose. How are you sure? If he is
coming in a fiacre, how is it that you arrive before him? You gave him our
address at least? Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the
corridor, on the right? If he only does not make a mistake! So you found him at
the church? Did he read my letter? What did he say to you? Ta, ta, ta, said the
girl, how you do gallop on, my good man! See here I entered the church, he was
in his usual place, I made him a reverence, and I handed him the letter he read
it and said to me Where do you live, my child? I said Monsieur, I will show
you. He said to me No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to
make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do.
I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and
hesitated for an instant, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1277 then he said
Never mind, I will come. When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the
church with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell
him the last door in the corridor, on the right. And what makes you think that
he will come? I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier.
That is what made me run so. How do you know that it was the same fiacre?
Because I took notice of the number, so there! What was the number? 440. Good,
you are a clever girl. The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the
shoes which she had on her feet A clever girl, possibly but I tell you I wont
put these shoes on again, and that I wont, for the sake of my health, in the
first place, and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I dont know anything
more irritating than shoes that squelch, and go ghi, ghi, ghi, the whole time. I
prefer to go barefoot. You are right, said her father, in a sweet tone which
contrasted with the young girls rudeness, but then, you will not be allowed to
enter churches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go
barefoot to the good God, he added bitterly. Then, returning to the subject
which absorbed him So you are sure that he will come? He is following on my
heels, said she. The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on 1278
Les Miserables his countenance. Wife! he exclaimed, you hear. Here is the
philanthropist. Extinguish the fire. The stupefied mother did not stir. The
father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug which stood
on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands. Then, addressing his eldest daughter
Here you! Pull the straw off that chair! His daughter did not understand. He
seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg passed
through it. As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter Is it cold? Very
cold. It is snowing. The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the
bed near the window, and shouted to her in a thundering voice Quick! get off
that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything? Break a pane of glass!
The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver. Break a pane! he repeated.
The child stood still in bewilderment. Do you hear me? repeated her father, I
tell you to break a pane! The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose
on tiptoe, and struck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a
loud clatter. Good, said the father. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1279 He
was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the
garret. One would have said that he was a general making the final preparation
at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning. The mother, who had
not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in a dull, slow, languid voice,
whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state What do you mean to do,
my dear? Get into bed, replied the man. His intonation admitted of no
deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threw herself heavily on one of the
pallets. In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner. Whats that? cried
the father. The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting
the corner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breaking
the window she went off, near her mothers pallet and wept silently. It was now
the mothers turn to start up and exclaim Just see there! What follies you
commit! She has cut herself breaking that pane for you! So much the better!
said the man. I foresaw that. What? So much the better? retorted his wife.
Peace! replied the father, I suppress the liberty of the press. Then tearing
the womans chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip of cloth with which he
hastily swathed the little girls bleeding wrist. That done, his eye fell with a
satisfied expression on his torn chemise. 1280 Les Miserables And the chemise
too, said he, this has a good appearance. An icy breeze whistled through the
window and entered the room. The outer mist penetrated thither and diffused
itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers.
Through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by
the Candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come. The father cast a
glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing. He
seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as
to entirely conceal them. Then drawing himself up and leaning against the
chimney-piece Now, said he, we can receive the philanthropist. Free eBooks at

approached and laid her hand in her fathers. Feel how cold I am, said she. Bah!
replied the father, I am much colder than that. The mother exclaimed
impetuously You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even
bad things. Down with you! said the man. The mother, being eyed after a certain
fashion, held her tongue. Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder
girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air
her younger sister continued to sob the mother had taken the latters head
between her hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the while
My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, dont cry, you will
anger your father. No! exclaimed the father, quite the contrary! sob! sob!
thats right. 1282 Les Miserables Then turning to the elder There now! He is not
coming! What if he were not to come! I shall have extinguished my fire, wrecked
my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my pane all for nothing. And wounded the
child! murmured the mother. Do you know, went on the father, that its beastly cold
in this devils garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! He
makes us wait! He says to himself Well! they will wait for me! Thats what
theyre there for. Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy, jubilation,
enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich folks! all those
rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on airs, who go to
mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, preachy, in their
skullcaps, and who think themselves above us, and who come for the purpose of
humiliating us, and to bring us clothes, as they say! old duds that are not
worth four sous! And bread! Thats not what I want, pack of rascals that they
are, its money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and
drink it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they,
then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could have
become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four corners of
the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would all be smashed, very
likely, but at least, no one would have anything, and there would be that much
gained! But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he
come? Perhaps the animal has forgotten the address! Ill bet that that old beast
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1283 At that moment there came a light tap at
the door, the man rushed to it and opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows
and smiles of adoration Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and
your charming young lady, also. A man of ripe age and a young girl made their
appearance on the threshold of the attic. Marius had not quitted his post. His
feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue. It was She!
Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three
letters of that word She. It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish
her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It
was that sweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six
months it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished face
which had created night by its departure. The vision had been eclipsed, now it
reappeared. It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen
attic, in all that horror. Marius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The
palpitations of his heart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink
of bursting into tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought
her so long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had just
found it again. She was the same as ever, only a little pale her delicate face
was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was 1284 Les Miserables
concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse
could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot. She was still
accompanied by M. Leblanc. She had taken a few steps into the room, and had
deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table. The eldest Jondrette girl had
retired behind the door, and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet
bonnet, that silk mantle, and that charming, happy face. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1285 CHAPTER IX JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING The hovel was so dark,
that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on
entering a cellar. The two new-comers advanced, therefore, with a certain
hesitation, being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them,
while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants
of the garret, who were accustomed to this twilight. M. Leblanc approached,
with his sad but kindly look, and said to Jondrette the father Monsieur, in
this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and
blankets. Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us, said Jondrette, bowing to the
very earth. Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two
visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added in a low
and rapid voice Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the
way, how was the letter to that old blockhead 1286 Les Miserables signed?
Fabantou, replied the girl. The dramatic artist, good! It was lucky for
Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the very moment, M. Leblanc
turned to him, and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to
recall a name I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur Fabantou,
replied Jondrette quickly. Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember. Dramatic
artist, sir, and one who has had some success. Here Jondrette evidently judged
the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist. He exclaimed with an
accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at
fairs, and the humility of the mendicant on the highway A pupil of Talma! Sir!
I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled on meAlas! Now it is misfortunes
turn. You see, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My
only chair has no seat! A broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed!
Ill! Poor woman! said M. Leblanc. My child wounded! added Jondrette. The child,
diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to contemplating the young
lady, and had ceased to sob. Cry! bawl! said Jondrette to her in a low voice.
At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1287 done with the talent of a juggler. The little girl gave vent to
loud shrieks. The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called his
Ursule, approached her hastily. Poor, dear child! said she. You see, my
beautiful young lady, pursued Jondrette her bleeding wrist! It came through an
accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day. It may be necessary
to cut off her arm. Really? said the old gentleman, in alarm. The little girl,
taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violently than ever. Alas! yes, my
benefactor! replied the father. For several minutes, Jondrette had been
scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be
examining the other attentively, as though seeking to summon up his
recollections. All at once, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were
questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his
wife, who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a
rapid but very low tone Take a look at that man! Then, turning to M. Leblanc,
and continuing his lamentations You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is
my wifes chemise! And all torn at that! In the depths of winter! I cant go out
for lack of a coat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see
Mademoiselle Mars, who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still
reside in the Rue de la Tour- 1288 Les Miserables des-Dames? Do you know, sir?
We played together in the provinces. I shared her laurels. Celimene would come
to my succor, sir! Elmire would bestow alms on Belisaire! But no, nothing! And
not a sou in the house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously
injured, not a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from her
age, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to have assistance,
and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary! How am I to pay them?
I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the condition to which the arts are
reduced. And do you know, my charming young lady, and you, my generous
protector, do you know, you who breathe forth virtue and goodness, and who
perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her
prayers?For I have brought up my children religiously, sir. I did not want them
to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not
jest, that I dont! I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask
them! They have got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches
who begin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is Mamselle
Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! None of that in the
Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, and they shall be honest,
and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, do
you know what is going to happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth day of
February, the fatal day, the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord if by
this evening I have not paid my rent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse
with her fever, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1289 my child with her wound,
we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street, on the
boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow. There, sir. I owe for
four quartersa whole year! that is to say, sixty francs. Jondrette lied. Four
quarters would have amounted to only forty francs, and he could not owe four,
because six months had not elapsed since Marius had paid for two. M. Leblanc
drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table. Jondrette found
time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter The scoundrel! What does he
think I can do with his five francs? That wont pay me for my chair and pane of
glass! Thats what comes of incurring expenses! In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had
removed the large brown great-coat which he wore over his blue coat, and had
thrown it over the back of the chair. Monsieur Fabantou, he said, these five
francs are all that I have about me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and
I will return this evening,it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?
Jondrettes face lighted up with a strange expression. He replied vivaciously Yes,
respected sir. At eight oclock, I must be at my landlords. I will be here at
six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs. My benefactor! exclaimed Jondrette,
overwhelmed. And he added, in a low tone Take a good look at him, wife! 1290
Les Miserables M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and
had turned towards the door. Farewell until this evening, my friends! said he.
Six oclock? said Jondrette. Six oclock precisely. At that moment, the overcoat
lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder Jondrette girl. You are
forgetting your coat, sir, said she. Jondrette darted an annihilating look at
his daughter, accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders. M. Leblanc
turned back and said, with a smile I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it. O
my protector! said Jondrette, my august benefactor, I melt into tears! Permit
me to accompany you to your carriage. If you come out, answered M. Leblanc, put
on this coat. It really is very cold. Jondrette did not need to be told twice.
He hastily donned the brown great-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette
preceding the two strangers. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1291 CHAPTER X
TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS TWO FRANCS AN HOUR Marius had lost nothing of this
entire scene, and yet, in reality, had seen nothing. His eyes had remained
fixed on the young girl, his heart had, so to speak, seized her and wholly
enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret. During her
entire stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material
perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated,
not that girl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet.
The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any
more dazzled. While the young girl was engaged in opening the package,
unfolding the clothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly,
and the little injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought
to catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, her walk,
he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that he had caught
a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure of the fact. He
would have 1292 Les Miserables given ten years of his life to hear it, in order
that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music. But everything was
drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This
added a touch of genuine wrath to Marius ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes.
He could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the
midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he
beheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads. When she took her departure, he
had but one thought, to follow her, to cling to her trace, not to quit her
until he learned where she lived, not to lose her again, at least, after having
so miraculously re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized
his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of
opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was long, the
staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet
regained his carriage if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the
staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would,
evidently, take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this
time it would be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a little? But while
he was waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he
accepted the risk and quitted his room. There was no one in the corridor. He
hastened to the stairs. There was no one on the staircase. He descended in all
haste, and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of
the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1293 back
to Paris. Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of
the boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the Rue
Mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off, and there was no means of
overtaking it what! run after it? Impossible and besides, the people in the
carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit
of a fiacre, and the father would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and
unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the
boulevard. There was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow
the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger. Marius made the
driver a sign to halt, and called to him By the hour? Marius wore no cravat, he
had on his working-coat, which was destitute of buttons, his shirt was torn
along one of the plaits on the bosom. The driver halted, winked, and held out
his left hand to Marius, rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb. What is
it? said Marius. Pay in advance, said the coachman. Marius recollected that he
had but sixteen sous about him. How much? he demanded. Forty sous. I will pay
on my return. The drivers only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse 1294
Les Miserables and to whip up his horse. Marius stared at the retreating
cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the lack of four and twenty sous, he was
losing his joy, his happiness, his love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind
again. He reflected bitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret,
on the five francs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable
girl. If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would have
been born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he would
have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowed state he might
have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden
thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same
instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in despair. He might have told
himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in the evening, and that all he
had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully, so that he might follow
him on that occasion but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had
heard this. As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on
the other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De la
Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the philanthropists great-coat,
engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have
been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of the barriers people of equivocal
face, of suspicious monologues, who present the air of having evil minds, and
who generally sleep in the daytime, which suggests the sup- Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1295 position that they work by night. These two men, standing
there motionless and in conversation, in the snow which was falling in
whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed, but
which Marius hardly noticed. Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he
could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with
whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier,
alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very
dangerous nocturnal roamer. This mans name the reader has learned in the
preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured
later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was at that
time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state of tradition among
ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of a school towards the end of the
last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and
talk in whispers, he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One
might even, in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served
the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843,
passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his
own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at flight. In
1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not as yet made a
serious beginning. 1296 Les Miserables CHAPTER XI OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY
TO WRETCHEDNESS Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment
when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder Jondrette
girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of this girl was odious
to him it was she who had his five francs, it was too late to demand them back,
the cab was no longer there, the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would not
have given them back. As for questioning her about the residence of the persons
who had just been there, that was useless it was evident that she did not know,
since the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman
of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas. Marius entered his room and pushed
the door to after him. It did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which
held the door half open. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1297 What is it? he
asked, who is there? It was the Jondrette girl. Is it you? resumed Marius
almost harshly, still you! What do you want with me? She appeared to be
thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had the air of assurance which
had characterized her that morning. She did not enter, but held back in the
darkness of the corridor, where Marius could see her through the half-open
door. Come now, will you answer? cried Marius. What do you want with me? She
raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely, and
said Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you? With me! said
Marius. Yes, you. There is nothing the matter with me. Yes, there is! No. I
tell you there is! Let me alone! Marius gave the door another push, but she
retained her hold on it. Stop, said she, you are in the wrong. Although you are
not rich, you were kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to
eat, now tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want
you to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employ me.
I do 1298 Les Miserables not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to
me, but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help
my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquire
from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one, I am of service.
Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you, and I will go and
speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons,
that suffices to let them understand matters, and everything comes right. Make
use of me. An idea flashed across Marius mind. What branch does one disdain
when one feels that one is falling? He drew near to the Jondrette girl. Listen
he said to her. She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes. Oh yes, do
call me thou! I like that better. Well, he resumed, thou hast brought hither
that old gentleman and his daughter! Yes. Dost thou know their address? No.
Find it for me. The Jondrettes dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became
gloomy. Is that what you want? she demanded. Yes. Do you know them? No. That is
to say, she resumed quickly, you do not know her, but you wish to know her.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1299 This them which had turned into her had
something indescribably significant and bitter about it. Well, can you do it?
said Marius. You shall have the beautiful ladys address. There was still a
shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled Marius. He resumed Never
mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their address, indeed!
She gazed fixedly at him. What will you give me? Anything you like. Anything I
like? Yes. You shall have the address. She dropped her head then, with a
brusque movement, she pulled to the door, which closed behind her. Marius found
himself alone. He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his
bed, absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to
vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the
angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of
hope floating in an immense despair, this was what filled his brain confusedly.
All at once he was violently aroused from his revery. He heard the shrill, hard
voice of Jondrette utter these words, which were fraught with a strange
interest for him I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized 1300
Les Miserables him. Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M.
Leblanc? The father of his Ursule? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius
about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information
without which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last who it
was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense
shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about
to be rent? Ah! Heavens! He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and
resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall. Again he
beheld the interior of Jondrettes hovel. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1301
CHAPTER XII THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANCS FIVEFRANC PIECE Nothing in the aspect
of the family was altered, except that the wife and daughters had levied on the
package and put on woollen stockings and jackets. Two new blankets were thrown
across the two beds. Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the
breathlessness of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the
fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the youngers wounded hand. His wife
had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative of
astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides.
His eyes were extraordinary. The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with
stupor in the presence of her husband, turned to say What, really? You are
sure? Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize him.
I knew him at once! What! Didnt it force 1302 Les Miserables itself on you? No.
But I told you Pay attention! Why, it is his figure, it is his face, only
older,there are people who do not grow old, I dont know how they manage it,it
is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious
old devil, Ive got you, that I have! He paused, and said to his daughters Get
out of here, you!Its queer that it didnt strike you! They arose to obey. The
mother stammered With her injured hand. The air will do it good, said
Jondrette. Be off. It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one
offers to reply. The two girls departed. At the moment when they were about to
pass through the door, the father detained the elder by the arm, and said to
her with a peculiar accent You will be here at five oclock precisely. Both of
you. I shall need you. Marius redoubled his attention. On being left alone with
his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room again, and made the tour of it two
or three times in silence. Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower
part of the womans chemise which he wore into his trousers. All at once, he
turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and exclaimed Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1303 And would you like to have me tell you something? The
young lady Well, what? retorted his wife, the young lady? Marius could not
doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking. He listened with
ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears. But Jondrette had bent over and
spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he straightened himself up and concluded
aloud It is she! That one? said his wife. That very one, said the husband. No
expression can reproduce the significance of the mothers words. Surprise, rage,
hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation. The
pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which her husband had
whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge, somnolent woman, and
from being repulsive she became terrible. It is not possible! she cried. When I
think that my daughters are going barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs!
What! A satin pelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything more than two
hundred francs worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No,
you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and this one
is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It cant be she! I tell
you that it is she. You will see. At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette
woman raised 1304 Les Miserables her large, red, blonde face and stared at the
ceiling with a horrible expression. At that moment, she seemed to Marius even
more to be feared than her husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.
What! she resumed, that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at my
daughters with an air of pity,she is that beggar brat! Oh! I should like to
kick her stomach in for her! She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing
for a moment, her hair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open,
her fists clenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The
man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female. After a silence
lasting several minutes, he approached the female Jondrette, and halted in
front of her, with folded arms, as he had done a moment before And shall I tell
you another thing? What is it? she asked. He answered in a low, curt voice My
fortune is made. The woman stared at him with the look that signifies Is the
person who is addressing me on the point of going mad? He went on Thunder! It
was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of
die-of-hunger-if-you-have-afire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have had
enough of misery! my share and other peoples share! I am not joking any longer,
I dont find it comic any more, Ive had enough Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1305 of puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am
full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I want
to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of a
millionnaire! He took a turn round the hovel, and added Like other people. What
do you mean by that? asked the woman. He shook his head, winked, screwed up one
eye, and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration
What do I mean by that? Listen! Hush! muttered the woman, not so loud! These
are matters which must not be overheard. Bah! Whos here? Our neighbor? I saw
him go out a little while ago. Besides, he doesnt listen, the big booby. And I
tell you that I saw him go out. Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette
lowered his voice, although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his
words. One favorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of
this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on
the boulevard. This is what Marius heard Listen carefully. The Croesus is
caught, or as good as caught! Thats all settled already. Everything is
arranged. I have seen some people. He will come here this evening at six
oclock. To bring sixty francs, the rascal! Did you notice how I played that
game on him, my sixty francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I dont even
owe for one 1306 Les Miserables quarter! Isnt he a fool! So he will come at six
oclock! Thats the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is
off washing dishes in the city. Theres not a soul in the house. The neighbor
never comes home until eleven oclock. The children shall stand on watch. You
shall help us. He will give in. And what if he does not give in? demanded his
wife. Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said Well fix him. And he burst
out laughing. This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was
cold and sweet, and provoked a shudder. Jondrette opened a cupboard near the
fireplace, and drew from it an old cap, which he placed on his head, after
brushing it with his sleeve. Now, said he, Im going out. I have some more
people that I must see. Good ones. Youll see how well the whole thing will
work. I shall be away as short a time as possible, its a fine stroke of
business, do you look after the house. And with both fists thrust into the
pockets of his trousers, he stood for a moment in thought, then exclaimed Do
you know, its mighty lucky, by the way, that he didnt recognize me! If he had
recognized me on his side, he would not have come back again. He would have
slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that saved us! my romantic beard!
my pretty little romantic beard! And again he broke into a laugh. He stepped to
the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the gray of the sky. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1307 What beastly weather! said he. Then lapping his
overcoat across his breast This rind is too large for me. Never mind, he added,
he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it
hadnt been for that, I couldnt have gone out, and everything would have gone
wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway! And pulling his cap down over
his eyes, he quitted the room. He had barely had time to take half a dozen
steps from the door, when the door opened again, and his savage but intelligent
face made its appearance once more in the opening. I came near forgetting, said
he. You are to have a brazier of charcoal ready. And he flung into his wifes
apron the five-franc piece which the philanthropist had left with him. A
brazier of charcoal? asked his wife. Yes. How many bushels? Two good ones. That
will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for dinner. The
devil, no. Why? Dont go and spend the hundred-sou piece. Why? Because I shall
have to buy something, too. What? 1308 Les Miserables Something. How much shall
you need? Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmongers shop? Rue
Mouffetard. Ah! yes, at the corner of a street I can see the shop. But tell me
how much you will need for what you have to purchase? Fifty sousthree francs.
There wont be much left for dinner. Eating is not the point to-day. Theres
something better to be done. Thats enough, my jewel. At this word from his
wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this time, Marius heard his step die
away in the corridor of the hovel, and descend the staircase rapidly. At that
moment, one oclock struck from the church of Saint-Medard. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1309 CHAPTER XIII SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR
ORARE PATER NOSTER Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and
energetic by nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had
developed in him sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty
for irritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had the
kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a toad,
but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had
just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes.
These wretches must be stamped upon, said he. Not one of the enigmas which he
had hoped to see solved had been elucidated on the contrary, all of them had
been rendered more dense, if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful
maiden of the Luxembourg and the man 1310 Les Miserables whom he called M.
Leblanc, except that Jondrette was acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious
words which had been uttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct
glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but
terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her
father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the
Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken. He scanned
the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old sheet-iron stove from
a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron. He descended from
the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to make the least noise.
Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and in the horror with which the
Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it
might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved.
But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not know
their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes, and had then
plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M.
Leblanc at the door that evening at six oclock, at the moment of his arrival,
and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch,
the spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise means to
seize him or to get him away, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would
be lost. One oclock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius
had five Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1311 hours before him. There was but one
thing to be done. He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round
his neck, took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he
had been treading on moss with bare feet. Moreover, the Jondrette woman
continued to rummage among her old iron. Once outside of the house, he made for
the Rue du PetitBanquier. He had almost reached the middle of this street, near
a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points, and which
abuts on a waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his
preoccupied condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once
he heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was
deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he distinctly
heard voices. It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.
There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against the
wall, talking together in subdued tones. These two persons were strangers to
him one was a bearded man in a blouse, and the other a long-haired individual
in rags. The bearded man had on a fez, the others head was bare, and the snow
had lodged in his hair. By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear
their remarks. The hairy one jogged the other mans elbow and said 1312 Les
Miserables With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it cant fail. Do you think
so? said the bearded man. And the long-haired one began again Its as good as a
warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the worst that can happen is
five years, six years, ten years at the most! The other replied with some
hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez Thats a real thing. You cant go
against such things. I tell you that the affair cant go wrong, resumed the
long-haired man. Father Whats-his-names team will be already harnessed. Then
they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening
at the Gaite Theatre. Marius went his way. It seemed to him that the mysterious
words of these men, so strangely hidden behind that wall, and crouching in the
snow, could not but bear some relation to Jondrettes abominable projects. That
must be the affair. He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau
and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of
police. He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14. Thither Marius betook
himself. As he passed a bakers shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it,
foreseeing that he should not dine. On the way, he rendered justice to
Providence. He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette
girl in the morning, he would have followed M. Leblancs Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1313 fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorant of everything,
and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and
that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and his daughter with him, no doubt. 1314
Les Miserables CHAPTER XIV IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A
LAWYER On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor
and inquired for the commissary of police. The commissary of police is not
here, said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place. Would you
like to speak to him? Are you in haste? Yes, said Marius. The clerk introduced
him into the commissarys office. There stood a tall man behind a grating,
leaning against a stove, and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast
topcoat, with three collars. His face was square, with a thin, firmmouth,
thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was enough to turn
your pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, not that
it penetrated, but that it searched. This mans air was not much less ferocious
nor less terrible than Jondrettes the dog is, at times, no less terrible to
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1315 meet than the wolf. What do you want? he
said to Marius, without adding monsieur. Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de
Police? He is absent. I am here in his stead. The matter is very private. Then
speak. And great haste is required. Then speak quick. This calm, abrupt man was
both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time. He inspired fear and
confidence. Marius related the adventure to him That a person with whom he was
not acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that
very evening that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius
Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition that the
wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette that there would be
accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain
Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille that Jondrettes daughters were to
lie in wait that there was no way of warning the threatened man, since he did
not even know his name and that, finally, all this was to be carried out at six
oclock that evening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de lHopital,
in house No. 50-52. At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head,
and said coldly So it is in the room at the end of the corridor? Precisely,
answered Marius, and he added Are you ac- 1316 Les Miserables quainted with
that house? The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he
warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove Apparently. He went on,
muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat
Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this. This word struck Marius.
Patron-Minette, said he, I did hear that word pronounced, in fact. And he repeated
to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man
in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The inspector
muttered The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard,
alias Deux-Milliards. He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in
thought. As for Father Whats-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, Ive
burned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves. Number
50-52. Former property of Gorbeau. Then he glanced at Marius. You saw only that
bearded and that long-haired man? And Panchaud. You didnt see a little imp of a
dandy prowling about the premises? No. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1317 Nor
a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes? No. Nor
a scamp with the air of an old red tail? No. As for the fourth, no one sees
him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and employees. It is not surprising that
you did not see him. No. Who are all those persons? asked Marius. The inspector
answered Besides, this is not the time for them. He relapsed into silence, then
resumed 50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it
without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply by
countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience embarrasses
them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing and make them dance.
This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at him
intently the while Are you afraid? Of what? said Marius. Of these men? No more
than yourself! retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to notice that this police
agent had not yet said monsieur to him. The inspector stared still more
intently at Marius, and continued with sententious solemnity There, you speak
like a brave man, and like an honest 1318 Les Miserables man. Courage does not
fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority. Marius interrupted him That is
well, but what do you intend to do? The inspector contented himself with the
remark The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must have
one. Yes, said Marius. Have you it about you? Yes. Give it to me, said the
inspector. Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the
inspector and added If you will take my advice, you will come in force. The
inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a
provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he
plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the two immense pockets of his
top-coat, and pulled out two small steel pistols, of the sort called
knock-me-downs. Then he presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt
tone Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed to
have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will keep watch
there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These men will come.
Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you think matters have reached
a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon.
The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1319 all things, not too soon. Wait until they
begin to put their project into execution you are a lawyer you know the proper
point. Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat.
That makes a lump that can be seen, said the inspector. Put them in your
trousers pocket. Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets. Now, pursued
the inspector, there is not a minute more to be lost by any one. What time is
it? Half-past two. Seven oclock is the hour? Six oclock, answered Marius. I
have plenty of time, said the inspector, but no more than enough. Dont forget
anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot. Rest easy, said Marius.
And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, the
inspector called to him By the way, if you have occasion for my services
between now and then, come or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.
1320 Les Miserables CHAPTER XV JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES A few moments
later, about three oclock, Courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the Rue
Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and
filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac One would say, to see all
these snow-flakes fall, that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven.
All at once, Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards the
barrier with a peculiar air. Hold! said Bossuet. Theres Marius. I saw him, said
Courfeyrac. Dont lets speak to him. Why? He is busy. With what? Dont you see
his air? What air? He has the air of a man who is following some one. Thats
true, said Bossuet. Just see the eyes he is making! said Courfeyrac. Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1321 But who the deuce is he following? Some fine, flowery
bonneted wench! Hes in love. But, observed Bossuet, I dont see any wench nor
any flowery bonnet in the street. Theres not a woman round. Courfeyrac took a
survey, and exclaimed Hes following a man! A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap,
and whose gray beard could be distinguished, although they only saw his back,
was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius. This man was dressed
in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him, and in a
frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud. Bossuet
burst out laughing. Who is that man? He? retorted Courfeyrac, hes a poet. Poets
are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the
overcoats of peers of France. Lets see where Marius will go, said Bossuet lets
see where the man is going, lets follow them, hey? Bossuet! exclaimed
Courfeyrac, eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious brute. Follow a man who is
following another man, indeed! They retraced their steps. Marius had, in fact,
seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, and was spying on his
proceedings. Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was
already held by a glance. He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him en-
1322 Les Miserables ter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse he
remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard.
He halted at an ironmongers shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue
Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop,
holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he
concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he
turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day
was declining the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again.
Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du
Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into
it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall
where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing,
Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, did not see him,
then sprang across the wall and disappeared. The waste land bordered by this
wall communicated with the back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad
repute, who had failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under
his sheds. Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrettes absence
to return home moreover, it was growing late every evening, Maam Bougon when
she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking the door,
which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to the inspector of
police it was important, therefore, that he should make haste. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1323 Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in on the
horizon and in the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated
by the sun, and that was the moon. It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low
dome of Salpetriere. Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door
was still open when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided
along the wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader
will remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for the
moment, empty and to let. Maam Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors
open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceived in the
uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted up by a
remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer window, Marius made no attempt to
see, not wishing to be seen himself. He succeeded in reaching his chamber
without being seen and without making any noise. It was high time. A moment
later he heard Maam Bougon take her departure, locking the door of the house
behind her. 1324 Les Miserables CHAPTER XVI IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO
AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN FASHION IN 1832 Marius seated himself on his bed.
It might have been half-past five oclock. Only half an hour separated him from
what was about to happen. He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the
ticking of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going
on at that moment in the dark,crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on
the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder of what
was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenly
assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the
effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of
a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers
pockets. It was no longer snowing the moon disengaged itself Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1325 more and more clearly from the mist, and its light,
mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen, communicated to
the chamber a sort of twilight aspect. There was a light in the Jondrette den.
Marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody
to him. It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,
there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving there,
not a soul speaking, not a breath the silence was glacial and profound, and had
it not been for that light, he might have thought himself next door to a
sepulchre. Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.
Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy
step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor the latch of the
hovel was noisily lifted it was Jondrette returning. Instantly, several voices
arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only, it had been silent in the
masters absence, like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf. Its I, said he.
Good evening, daddy, yelped the girls. Well? said the mother. Alls going
first-rate, responded Jondrette, but my feet are beastly cold. Good! You have
dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire confidence. All ready to go
out. Dont forget what I told you. You will do everything 1326 Les Miserables
sure? Rest easy. Because said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.
Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel which he
had purchased. By the way, said Jondrette, have you been eating here? Yes, said
the mother. I got three large potatoes and some salt. I took advantage of the fire
to cook them. Good, returned Jondrette. To-morrow I will take you out to dine
with me. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the Tenth
all is going well! Then he added The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there. He
lowered his voice still further, and said Put this in the fire. Marius heard a
sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil, and
Jondrette continued Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will
not squeak? Yes, replied the mother. What time is it? Nearly six. The half-hour
struck from Saint-Medard a while ago. The devil! ejaculated Jondrette the
children must go and watch. Come you, do you listen here. A whispering ensued.
Jondrettes voice became audible again Has old Bougon left? Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1327 Yes, said the mother. Are you sure that there is no one
in our neighbors room? He has not been in all day, and you know very well that
this is his dinner hour. You are sure? Sure. All the same, said Jondrette,
theres no harm in going to see whether he is there. Here, my girl, take the
candle and go there. Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently
under his bed. Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light
through the crack of his door. Ppa, cried a voice, he is not in here. He
recognized the voice of the eldest daughter. Did you go in? demanded her
father. No, replied the girl, but as his key is in the door, he must be out.
The father exclaimed Go in, nevertheless. The door opened, and Marius saw the
tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in
the morning, only still more repulsive in this light. She walked straight up to
the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety but near the bed
there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was thither that she was
directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it.
In the neighboring room, the sound of iron 1328 Les Miserables articles being
moved was audible. She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled
into the mirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice Nos amours ont
dure toute une semaine, Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts! Sadorer
huit jours, c etait bien la peine! Le temps des amours devait durer toujours!
Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours! Our love has lasted a whole
week, but how short are the instants of happiness! To adore each other for
eight days was hardly worth the while! The time of love should last forever. In
the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she should not
hear his breathing. She stepped to the window and looked out with the
halffoolish way she had. How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!
said she. She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,
scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn. Well! cried her
father, what are you about there? I am looking under the bed and the furniture,
she replied, continuing to arrange her hair theres no one here. Booby! yelled
her father. Come here this minute! And dont waste any time about it! Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1329 Coming! Coming! said she. One has no time for
anything in this hovel! She hummed Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire Mon
triste coeur suivra partout. You leave me to go to glory my sad heart will
follow you everywhere. She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out,
shutting the door behind her. A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the
two young girls bare feet in the corridor, and Jondrettes voice shouting to
them Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the corner
of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Dont lose sight for a moment of the door of this
house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on the instant! as hard as
you can go! You have a key to get in. The eldest girl grumbled The idea of
standing watch in the snow barefoot! To-morrow you shall have some dainty
little green silk boots! said the father. They ran down stairs, and a few
seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they
were outside. There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and
probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom 1330 Les Miserables Marius had
caught a glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic. Free

PIECE Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his
post at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age, he
had reached the hole in the partition. He looked. The interior of the Jondrette
apartment presented a curious aspect, and Marius found an explanation of the
singular light which he had noticed. A candle was burning in a candlestick
covered with verdigris, but that was not what really lighted the chamber. The
hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather
large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning
charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The
charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red a blue flame flickered over
it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in
the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In
one corner, near the door, and as though pre- 1332 Les Miserables pared for
some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap
of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused the mind of a
person who knew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between a very
sinister and a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a
forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of
a demon than of a smith. The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle
on the table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping
over. An old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood
on the chimney-piece. The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the
nearly extinct brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.
The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its whiteness
into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetic spirit of Marius, who was
dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled
with the misshapen reveries of earth. A breath of air which made its way in
through the open pane, helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to
conceal the presence of the brazier. The Jondrette lair was, if the reader
recalls what we have said of the Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as
the theatre of a violent and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It
was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted
boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed,
they Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1333 would have been invented there. The
whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this
den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed opened on waste lands
enclosed with walls and palisades. Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated
himself on the seatless chair, and was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking
to him in a low tone. If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of
those men who laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with
laughter when his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet
with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of
Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the mans
shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this toilette which
had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation Good! You have dressed up. You
have done well. You must inspire confidence! As for Jondrette, he had not taken
off the new surtout, which was too large for him, and which M. Leblanc had
given him, and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and
trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyracs eyes. All at
once, Jondrette lifted up his voice By the way! Now that I think of it. In this
weather, he will come in a carriage. Light the lantern, take it and go down
stairs. You will stand behind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the
carriage stop, you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will
light the staircase 1334 Les Miserables and the corridor, and when he enters
here, you will go down stairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the
coachman, and dismiss the fiacre. And the money? inquired the woman. Jondrette
fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs. Whats this? she
exclaimed. Jondrette replied with dignity That is the monarch which our
neighbor gave us this morning. And he added Do you know what? Two chairs will
be needed here. What for? To sit on. Marius felt a cold chill pass through his
limbs at hearing this mild answer from Jondrette. Pardieu! Ill go and get one
of our neighbors. And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den,
and went out into the corridor. Marius absolutely had not the time to descend
from the commode, reach his bed, and conceal himself beneath it. Take the
candle, cried Jondrette. No, said she, it would embarrass me, I have the two
chairs to carry. There is moonlight. Marius heard Mother Jondrettes heavy hand
fumbling at his lock in the dark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the
spot with the shock and with horror. The Jondrette entered. The dormer window permitted
the entrance of a ray of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1335 moonlight between
two blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall
against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it. Mother
Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two chairs, the only
ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the door fall heavily to
behind her. She re-entered the lair. Here are the two chairs. And here is the
lantern. Go down as quick as you can. She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was
left alone. He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the
chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked
the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent
down as though to examine something. Marius then recognized the fact, that what
he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden
rungs and two hooks with which to attach it. This ladder, and some large tools,
veritable masses of iron, which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind
the door, had not been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently
been brought thither in the afternoon, during Marius absence. Those are the
utensils of an edge-tool maker, thought Marius. Had Marius been a little more
learned in this line, he would have recognized in what he took for the engines
of an edge-tool maker, certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a
lock, and others which will cut or slice, the 1336 Les Miserables two families
of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants. The fireplace and the two
chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The brazier being concealed, the only
light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery
on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something
indescribably calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that
there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible. Jondrette had
allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation, and had again
seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his
countenance. He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand,
as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue.
In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, he
pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen knife
which was concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That
done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it. Marius, on his side,
grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it out and cocked it. The pistol
emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it. Jondrette started, half rose,
listened a moment, then began to laugh and said What a fool I am! Its the
partition cracking! Marius kept the pistol in his hand. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1337 CHAPTER XVIII MARIUS TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS Suddenly, the
distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes. Six oclock was
striking from SaintMedard. Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his
head. When the sixth had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers. Then
he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor, walked on
again, then listened once more. Provided only that he comes! he muttered, then
he returned to his chair. He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.
Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making a horrible,
amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern illuminated from
below. Enter, sir, she said. Enter, my benefactor, repeated Jondrette, rising
hastily. M. Leblanc made his appearance. He wore an air of serenity which
rendered him singu- 1338 Les Miserables larly venerable. He laid four louis on
the table. Monsieur Fabantou, said he, this is for your rent and your most
pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter. May God requite it
to you, my generous benefactor! said Jondrette. And rapidly approaching his
wife Dismiss the carriage! She slipped out while her husband was lavishing
salutes and offering M. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and
whispered in his ear Tis done. The snow, which had not ceased falling since the
morning, was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and
they did not now hear its departure. Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.
Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc. Now, in
order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture
to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpetriere
covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taperlike
lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those
tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps
a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of
silence, of horror, and of darkness in that building, in the midst of those
solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jon- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1339 drette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two
men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the
Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition,
Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his
eye on the watch, and pistol in hand. However, Marius experienced only an
emotion of horror, but no fear. He clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and
felt reassured. I shall be able to stop that wretch whenever I please, he
thought. He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for
the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm. Moreover, he was in
hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondrette and M. Leblanc would cast
some light on all the things which he was interested in learning. 1340 Les
Miserables CHAPTER XIX OCCUPYING ONES SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS Hardly was M.
Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the pallets, which were empty.
How is the poor little wounded girl? he inquired. Bad, replied Jondrette with a
heart-broken and grateful smile, very bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has
taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently
they will be back immediately. Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better, went
on M. Leblanc, casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette
woman, as she stood between him and the door, as though already guarding the
exit, and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat. She is
dying, said Jondrette. But what do you expect, sir! She has so much courage,
that woman has! Shes not a woman, shes an ox. The Jondrette, touched by his compliment,
deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster. You are always too
good to me, Monsieur Jondrette! Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1341 Jondrette!
said M. Leblanc, I thought your name was Fabantou? Fabantou, alias Jondrette!
replied the husband hurriedly. An artistic sobriquet! And launching at his wife
a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did not catch, he continued with an
emphatic and caressing inflection of voice Ah! we have had a happy life
together, this poor darling and I! What would there be left for us if we had
not that? We are so wretched, my respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no
work! We have the will, no work! I dont know how the government arranges that,
but, on my word of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.30 I
dont wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word,
things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have my girls taught
the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me What! a trade? Yes! A trade!
A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor! What a degradation,
when one has been what we have been! Alas! There is nothing left to us of our
days of prosperity! One thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal,
but which I am willing to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live! 30 A
democrat. While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which
detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his
physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room
a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered, so softly that
the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. 1342 Les Miserables This man
wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at
every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt,
had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black. He
had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behind
Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen. That sort of magnetic instinct
which turns aside the gaze, caused M. Leblanc to turn round almost at the same
moment as Marius. He could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not
escape Jondrette. Ah! I see! exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an
air of complaisance, you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith,
but it fits me! Who is that man? said M. Leblanc. Him? ejaculated Jondrette,
hes a neighbor of mine. Dont pay any attention to him. The neighbor was a
singular-looking individual. However, manufactories of chemical products abound
in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the workmen might have black faces.
Besides this, M. Leblancs whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid
confidence. He went on Excuse me what were you saying, M. Fabantou? I was
telling you, sir, and dear protector, replied Jondrette placing his elbows on
the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and tender eyes, not unlike
the eyes of the boa-constrictor, I was telling you, that I have a picture to
sell. A slight sound came from the door. A second man had Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1343 just entered and seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.
Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or lampblack.
Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been able to
prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him. Dont mind them, said Jondrette, they
are people who belong in the house. So I was saying, that there remains in my
possession a valuable picture. But stop, sir, take a look at it. He rose, went
to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already
mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported against the wall. It
really was something which resembled a picture, and which the candle
illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of it, as Jondrette stood
between the picture and him he only saw a coarse daub, and a sort of principal
personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen
paintings. What is that? asked M. Leblanc. Jondrette exclaimed A painting by a
master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am as much attached to it as
I am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs to me! But I have told you, and I
will not take it back, that I am so wretched that I will part with it. Either
by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, M. Leblancs
glance returned to the bottom 1344 Les Miserables of the room as he examined
the picture. There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing
near the door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared
with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with closed
eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was old his white
hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect. The other
two seemed to be young one wore a beard, the other wore his hair long. None of
them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted. Jondrette
noticed that M. Leblancs eye was fixed on these men. They are friends. They are
neighbors, said he. Their faces are black because they work in charcoal. They
are chimney-builders. Dont trouble yourself about them, my benefactor, but buy
my picture. Have pity on my misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do
you think it is worth? Well, said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the
eye, and with the manner of a man who is on his guard, it is some signboard for
a tavern, and is worth about three francs. Jondrette replied sweetly Have you
your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns. M.
Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid glance
around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, and
the Jondrette Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1345 woman and the four men on
his right, on the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not
even seem to be looking on. Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive
tone, with so vague an eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc
might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone
mad with misery. If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor, said
Jondrette, I shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me
but to throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my two
girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for New
Years gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from
falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a pot with three
compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste, according as
it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife to cut the cardboard,
a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I
know what all? And all that in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to
work fourteen hours a day! And each box passes through the workwomans hands
thirteen times! And you cant wet the paper! And you mustnt spot anything! And
you must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you
suppose a man is to live? As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc,
who was observing him. M. Leblancs eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrettes
eye was fixed on the door. Marius eager attention was transferred from one to
the other. M. Leblanc 1346 Les Miserables seemed to be asking himself Is this
man an idiot? Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner
of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order There is nothing
left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps at the
side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose. All at once
his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man drew himself up
and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of
thunder That has nothing to do with the question! Do you know me? Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1347 CHAPTER XX THE TRAP The door of the garret had just
opened abruptly, and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses,
and masked with masks of black paper. The first was thin, and had a long,
iron-tipped cudgel the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the
middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a butchers pole-axe for
slaughtering cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender
as the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some
prison. It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been
waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel,
the thin one. Is everything ready? said Jondrette. Yes, replied the thin man.
Where is Montparnasse? The young principal actor stopped to chat with your
girl. Which? The eldest. Is there a carriage at the door? 1348 Les Miserables
Yes. Is the team harnessed? Yes. With two good horses? Excellent. Is it waiting
where I ordered? Yes. Good, said Jondrette. M. Leblanc was very pale. He was
scrutinizing everything around him in the den, like a man who understands what
he has fallen into, and his head, directed in turn toward all the heads which
surrounded him, moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but
there was nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised an
intrenchment out of the table and the man, who but an instant previously, had
borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had suddenly become a sort of
athlete, and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable
and surprising gesture. This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the
presence of such a danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as
courageous as they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom
we love is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man. Three
of the men, of whom Jondrette had said They are chimney-builders, had armed
themselves from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair of shears, the
second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and had placed themselves
across the entrance without uttering a sylla- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1349 ble. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes.
The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him. Marius decided that in a few
seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive, and he raised his right
hand towards the ceiling, in the direction of the corridor, in readiness to
discharge his pistol. Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man
with the cudgel, turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question,
accompanying it with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar
to him So you do not recognize me? M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and
replied No. Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,
crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblancs
calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to retreat,
and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite, he exclaimed My name
is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Thenardier. I am the
inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Thenardier! Now do you know me?
An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblancs brow, and he replied with a
voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his
accustomed placidity No more than before. Marius did not hear this reply. Any
one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have per- 1350
Les Miserables ceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the
moment when Jondrette said My name is Thenardier, Marius had trembled in every
limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel
blade through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal
shot, dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, Thenardier, do
you understand? Mariuss faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol
fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc, but he
had quite upset Marius. That name of Thenardier, with which M. Leblanc did not
seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader recall what that name
meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart, inscribed in his fathers
testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory,
in that sacred injunction A certain Thenardier saved my life. If my son
encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power. That name,
it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul he mingled it with
the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, that
inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! He had
found him at last, and how? His fathers saviour was a ruffian! That man, to
whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, was a monster! That
liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose
scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend, but which resembled an
assassination! And against whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter
mockery of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to
do all the good in his power Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1351 to this Thenardier,
and for four years Marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this
debt of his fathers, and at the moment when he was on the eve of having a
brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice, destiny cried to him This
is Thenardier! He could at last repay this man for his fathers life, saved amid
a hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it with
the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that Thenardier, he
would address him only by throwing himself at his feet and now he actually had
found him, but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner! His father
said to him Succor Thenardier! And he replied to that adored and sainted voice
by crushing Thenardier! He was about to offer to his father in his grave the
spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life,
executed on the Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that
Marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have
so long worn on his breast his fathers last commands, written in his own hand,
only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look
on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin!
Could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas
which Marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and
through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow. He shuddered. Everything depended
on him. Unknown to themselves, he held in his hand all those beings who were
moving about there before his eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was
saved, and Thenardier lost if he did not fire, M. 1352 Les Miserables Leblanc
would be sacrificed, and, who knows? Thenardier would escape. Should he dash
down the one or allow the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.
What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperious
souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty, to the
most venerated text! Should he ignore his fathers testament, or allow the
perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard his
Ursule supplicating for her father and on the other, the colonel commending
Thenardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad. His knees gave way
beneath him. And he had not even the time for deliberation, so great was the
fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It
was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was
now sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning. In the meantime,
Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other name, was pacing up and
down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph. He seized the
candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with so violent a bang that
the wick came near being extinguished, and the tallow bespattered the wall.
Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these words
Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked! And again he began to march back
and forth, in full eruption. Ah! he cried, so Ive found you again at last,
Mister philanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1353 dolls! you old ninny! Ah! so you dont recognize
me! No, it wasnt you who came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on
Christmas eve, 1823! It wasnt you who carried off that Fantines child from me!
The Lark! It wasnt you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds
in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his mania
to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out
with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock in
trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you dont
recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very
moment you poked your snout in here. Ah! youll find out presently, that it isnt
all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into peoples houses, under the
pretext that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poor man,
to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take
away their means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you cant call
things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that
is too large, and two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, you
child-stealer! He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One
would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone then,
as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to
himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and shouted And with
his goody-goody air! And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc Parbleu! You made game of
me in the past! You are the 1354 Les Miserables cause of all my misfortunes!
For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and who certainly
belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a great deal of money,
and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on all my life! A girl who
would have made up to me for everything that I lost in that vile cook-shop,
where there was nothing but one continual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up
my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been
poison to those who drank it! Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought
me ridiculous when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the
forest. You were the stronger. Revenge. Im the one to hold the trumps to-day!
Youre in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh!
Didnt he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was
Fabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche,
that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he
didnt even notice that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the
time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes
which he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadnt the heart even to go as high as a
hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said
to myself Blockhead! Come, Ive got you! I lick your paws this morning, but Ill
gnaw your heart this evening! Thenardier paused. He was out of breath. His
little, narrow chest panted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the
ignoble happiness of a feeble, cruel, and cowardly Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1355 creature, which finds that it can, at last, harass what it has
feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able
to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning
to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently
alive to suffer still. M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when
he paused I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a
very poor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You are
mistaking me for some other person. Ah! roared Thenardier hoarsely, a pretty
lie! You stick to that pleasantry, do you! Youre floundering, my old buck! Ah!
You dont remember! You dont see who I am? Excuse me, sir, said M. Leblanc with
a politeness of accent, which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and
powerful, I see that you are a villain! Who has not remarked the fact that
odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own, that monsters are
ticklish! At this word villain, the female Thenardier sprang from the bed,
Thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands.
Dont you stir! he shouted to his wife and, turning to M. Leblanc Villain! Yes,
I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop! its true that I became
bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no bread, that I have not a single
sou, that I am a villain! Its three days since I have had anything to eat, so
Im a villain! Ah! you folks warm your feet, you have 1356 Les Miserables
Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the
first floor in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at
forty francs the bunch in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge
yourselves, and when you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the
papers to see what the engineer Chevaliers thermometer says about it. We, it is
we who are thermometers. We dont need to go out and look on the quay at the
corner of the Tour de lHorologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold we
feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our hearts,
and we say There is no God! And you come to our caverns, yes our caverns, for
the purpose of calling us villains! But well devour you! But well devour you,
poor little things! Just see here, Mister millionnaire I have been a solid man,
I have held a license, I have been an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And
its quite possible that you are not! Here Thenardier took a step towards the
men who stood near the door, and added with a shudder When I think that he has
dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler! Then addressing M. Leblanc
with a fresh outburst of frenzy And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist!
Im not a suspicious character, not a bit of it! Im not a man whose name nobody
knows, and who comes and abducts children from houses! Im an old French
soldier, I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in
the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I dont know what. He Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1357 told me his name, but his beastly voice was so
weak that I didnt hear. All I caught was Merci thanks. Id rather have had his
name than his thanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture
that you see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,do you know
what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that feat of
prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through the
grape-shot. Theres the history of it! That general never did a single thing for
me he was no better than the rest! But none the less, I saved his life at the
risk of my own, and I have the certificate of the fact in my pocket! I am a
soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that I have had the goodness to
tell you all this, lets have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of
money, I must have an enormous lot of money, or Ill exterminate you, by the
thunder of the good God! Marius had regained some measure of control over his
anguish, and was listening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It
certainly was the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach of
ingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point of so
fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled. Moreover, there was in all
these words of Thenardier, in his accent, in his gesture, in his glance which
darted flames at every word, there was, in this explosion of an evil nature
disclosing everything, in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride
and pettiness, of rage and folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false
sentiments, in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous
delights of vio- 1358 Les Miserables lence, in that shameless nudity of a
repulsive soul, in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all
hatreds, something which was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the
truth. The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed
that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has divined,
than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered, by himself, the
only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at Montfermeil. As he had
ceased to intercept Marius visual ray, Marius could examine this thing, and in
the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a background of smoke, and a man
carrying another man. It was the group composed of Pontmercy and Thenardier the
sergeant the rescuer, the colonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man this
picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the signboard
of the wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection a tomb had yawned, a
phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples, he had
the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely depicted on
that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that the misshapen
spectre was gazing intently at him. When Thenardier had recovered his breath,
he turned his bloodshot eyes on M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice
What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you? M. Leblanc held his
peace. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1359 In the midst of this silence, a
cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor If theres any
wood to be split, Im there! It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.
At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its appearance
at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth, but fangs. It was
the face of the man with the butchers axe. Why have you taken off your mask?
cried Thenardier in a rage. For fun, retorted the man. For the last few minutes
M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of
Thenardier, who, blinded and dazzled by his own rage, was stalking to and fro
in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded, and of holding an
unarmed man fast, he being armed himself, of being nine against one, supposing
that the female Thenardier counted for but one man. During his address to the
man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back to M. Leblanc. M. Leblanc seized
this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist,
and with one bound, with prodigious agility, before Thenardier had time to turn
round, he had reached the window. To open it, to scale the frame, to bestride
it, was the work of a second only. He was half out when six robust fists seized
him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel. These were the three
chimney-builders, who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time the
Thenardier woman had wound her hands 1360 Les Miserables in his hair. At the
trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor. The old
man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of wine, descended from the
pallet and came reeling up, with a stone-breakers hammer in his hand. One of
the chimney-builders, whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle, and in
whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing, Panchaud, alias Printanier,
alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblancs head a sort of bludgeon made of two
balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron. Marius could not resist this
sight. My father, he thought, forgive me! And his finger sought the trigger of
his pistol. The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardiers
voice shouted Dont harm him! This desperate attempt of the victim, far from
exasperating Thenardier, had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the
ferocious man and the adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his
triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did
not stir, the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried
to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand. Dont hurt him! he
repeated, and without suspecting it, his first success was to arrest the pistol
in the act of being discharged, and to paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the
urgency of the case disappeared, and who, in the face of this Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1361 new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting a while
longer. Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him
from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursules father to perish, or of
destroying the colonels saviour? A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow
full in the chest, M. Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the
middle of the room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown
two more assailants, and he held one under each of his knees the wretches were
rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but
the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of
his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the two chimney-builders on the
floor. Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those
beneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain to
shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc disappeared
under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile
of dogs and hounds. They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the
window, and there they held him in awe. The Thenardier woman had not released
her clutch on his hair. Dont you mix yourself up in this affair, said Thenardier.
Youll tear your shawl. The Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male
wolf, with a growl. Now, said Thenardier, search him, you other fellows! 1362
Les Miserables M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance. They
searched him. He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing
six francs, and his handkerchief. Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own
pocket. What! No pocket-book? he demanded. No, nor watch, replied one of the
chimney-builders. Never mind, murmured the masked man who carried the big key,
in the voice of a ventriloquist, hes a tough old fellow. Thenardier went to the
corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men.
Tie him to the leg of the bed, said he. And, catching sight of the old man who
had been stretched across the room by the blow from M. Leblancs fist, and who
made no movement, he added Is Boulatruelle dead? No, replied Bigrenaille, hes
drunk. Sweep him into a corner, said Thenardier. Two of the chimney-builders pushed
the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet.
Babet, said Thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, why did you
bring so many they were not needed. What can you do? replied the man with the
cudgel, they all wanted to be in it. This is a bad season. Theres no business
going on. The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital
bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1363
roughly hewn. M. Leblanc let them take their own course. The ruffians bound him
securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet on the ground at the head of
the bed, the end which was most remote from the window, and nearest to the
fireplace. When the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair and seated
himself almost facing M. Leblanc. Thenardier no longer looked like himself in
the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to
tranquil and cunning sweetness. Marius found it difficult to recognize in that
polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had
been foaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and
alarming metamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a
tiger converted into a lawyer. Monsieur said Thenardier. And dismissing with a
gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on M. Leblanc Stand off a
little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman. All retired towards the
door. He went on Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You
might have broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse
quietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation which I
have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry. 1364 Les
Miserables Thenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had
escaped Marius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,
without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six ruffians
near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence.
Thenardier continued Mon Dieu! You might have shouted stop thief a bit, and I
should not have thought it improper. Murder! That, too, is said occasionally,
and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is
very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with
persons who dont inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might have done
that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You would not even
have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. Thats its
only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar
and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the
snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would
make a pouf. Its a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is
better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion
that I draw from that fact My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The
police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry that
is because you dont care to have the police and the courts come in any more
than we do. It is because,I have long suspected it,you have some interest in
hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an
understanding. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1365 As he spoke thus, it seemed
as though Thenardier, who kept his eyes fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to
plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience
of his prisoner. Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of
moderated, subdued insolence and crafty insolence, was reserved and almost
choice, and in that rascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time
previously, one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood. The
silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been carried to
the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that resistance opposed
to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter a cry, all this, it must be
confessed, now that his attention had been called to it, troubled Marius, and
affected him with painful astonishment. Thenardiers well-grounded observation
still further obscured for Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave
and singular person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur
Leblanc. But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners,
half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the
extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence of
Thenardiers wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man remained
impassive and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the
superbly melancholy visage. Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible
to terror, and which did not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those
men who command amazement in desper- 1366 Les Miserables ate circumstances.
Extreme as was the crisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing
here of the agony of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under
the water. Thenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace,
shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and
thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner could
plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet
stars. Then Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc. I continue, said
he. We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange this matter in an amicable
way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now, I dont know what I was thinking
of, I went a great deal too far, I said extravagant things. For example,
because you are a millionnaire, I told you that I exacted money, a lot of
money, a deal of money. That would not be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of
your riches, you have expenses of your own who has not? I dont want to ruin
you, I am not a greedy fellow, after all. I am not one of those people who,
because they have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make
themselves ridiculous. Why, Im taking things into consideration and making a
sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs. M. Leblanc
uttered not a word. Thenardier went on You see that I put not a little water in
my wine Im very moderate. I dont know the state of your fortune, but I do Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1367 know that you dont stick at money, and a
benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to
the father of a family who is out of luck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too
you havent imagined that I should take all the trouble I have to-day and
organized this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the
opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go
and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyers. Two hundred
thousand francsits surely worth all that. This trifle once out of your pocket,
I guarantee you that thats the end of the matter, and that you have no further
demands to fear. You will say to me But I havent two hundred thousand francs
about me. Oh! Im not extortionate. I dont demand that. I only ask one thing of
you. Have the goodness to write what I am about to dictate to you. Here
Thenardier paused then he added, emphasizing his words, and casting a smile in
the direction of the brazier I warn you that I shall not admit that you dont
know how to write. A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile. Thenardier
pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand, a pen, and a sheet
of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and in which gleamed the long
blade of the knife. He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc. Write, said
he. The prisoner spoke at last. How do you expect me to write? I am bound. 1368
Les Miserables Thats true, excuse me! ejaculated Thenardier, you are quite
right. And turning to Bigrenaille Untie the gentlemans right arm. Panchaud,
alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thenardiers order. When the
prisoners right arm was free, Thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and
presented it to him. Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at
our discretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we shall
be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities. I
know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you, that you will remain
bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to
write shall have returned. Now, be so good as to write. What? demanded the
prisoner. I will dictate. M. Leblanc took the pen. Thenardier began to dictate
My daughter The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thenardier. Put down
My dear daughter said Thenardier. M. Leblanc obeyed. Thenardier continued Come
instantly He paused You address her as thou, do you not? Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1369 Who? asked M. Leblanc. Parbleu! cried Thenardier, the little
one, the Lark. M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion I do
not know what you mean. Go on, nevertheless, ejaculated Thenardier, and he
continued to dictate Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The
person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me.
I am waiting for thee. Come with confidence. M. Leblanc had written the whole
of this. Thenardier resumed Ah! erase come with confidence that might lead her
to suppose that everything was not as it should be, and that distrust is
possible. M. Leblanc erased the three words. Now, pursued Thenardier, sign it.
Whats your name? The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded For whom is this
letter? You know well, retorted Thenardier, for the little one I just told you
so. It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question.
He said the Lark, he said the little one, but he did not pronounce her namethe
precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices. To mention
the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands, and to tell them
more about it than there was any need of their knowing. 1370 Les Miserables He
went on Sign. What is your name? Urbain Fabre, said the prisoner. Thenardier,
with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief
which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He looked for the mark on it, and held it
close to the candle. U. F. Thats it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F. The
prisoner signed. As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I
will fold it. That done, Thenardier resumed Address it, Mademoiselle Fabre, at
your house. I know that you live a long distance from here, near
Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas, because you go to mass there every day, but I dont
know in what street. I see that you understand your situation. As you have not
lied about your name, you will not lie about your address. Write it yourself.
The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and wrote
Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabres, Rue SaintDominique-DEnfer, No. 17.
Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion. Wife! he
cried. The Thenardier woman hastened to him. Heres the letter. You know what
you have to do. There is a carriage at the door. Set out at once, and return
ditto. And addressing the man with the meat-axe Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1371 Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You
will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team? Yes, said the
man. And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thenardier. As they
set off, Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door, and shouted
into the corridor Above all things, dont lose the letter! remember that you
carry two hundred thousand francs with you! The Thenardiers hoarse voice
replied Be easy. I have it in my bosom. A minute had not elapsed, when the
sound of the cracking of a whip was heard, which rapidly retreated and died
away. Good! growled Thenardier. Theyre going at a fine pace. At such a gallop,
the bourgeoise will be back inside threequarters of an hour. He drew a chair
close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presenting his muddy boots to the
brazier. My feet are cold! said he. Only five ruffians now remained in the den
with Thenardier and the prisoner. These men, through the black masks or paste
which covered their faces, and made of them, at fears pleasure,
charcoal-burners, negroes, or demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could
be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without
either wrath or mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one
1372 Les Miserables corner like brutes, and remained silent. Thenardier warmed
his feet. The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had
succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments
before. The candle, on which a large stranger had formed, cast but a dim light
in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those monstrous heads
cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling. No sound was audible except
the quiet breathing of the old drunken man, who was fast asleep. Marius waited
in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle. The enigma was more
impenetrable than ever. Who was this little one whom Thenardier had called the
Lark? Was she his Ursule? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that
word, the Lark, and had replied in the most natural manner in the world I do
not know what you mean. On the other hand, the two letters U. F. were explained
they meant Urbain Fabre and Ursule was no longer named Ursule. This was what
Marius perceived most clearly of all. A sort of horrible fascination held him
nailed to his post, from which he was observing and commanding this whole
scene. There he stood, almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though
annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited,
in the hope of some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not
collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1373 decide. In any case, he said, if she is the Lark, I shall see
her, for the Thenardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and
then I will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!
Nothing shall stop me. Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thenardier
seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still,
Marius fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a
faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner. All at once, Thenardier
addressed the prisoner By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to
you at once. These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation.
Marius strained his ears. My wife will be back shortly, dont get impatient. I
think that the Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural
that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt
her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so
that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They will
both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier,
there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be
taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other
vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us Its done. As for
the young lady, no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to a
place where she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to 1374
Les Miserables me those little two hundred thousand francs, she will be
returned to you. If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his
thumb to the Lark, thats all. The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a
pause, Thenardier continued Its very simple, as you see. Therell be no harm
done unless you wish that there should be harm done. Im telling you how things
stand. I warn you so that you may be prepared. He paused the prisoner did not
break the silence, and Thenardier resumed As soon as my wife returns and says
to me The Lark is on the way, we will release you, and you will be free to go
and sleep at home. You see that our intentions are not evil. Terrible images
passed through Marius mind. What! That young girl whom they were abducting was
not to be brought back? One of those monsters was to bear her off into the
darkness? Whither? And what if it were she! It was clear that it was she.
Marius felt his heart stop beating. What was he to do? Discharge the pistol?
Place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice? But the horrible man with
the meat-axe would, none the less, be out of reach with the young girl, and
Marius reflected on Thenardiers words, of which he perceived the bloody
significance If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb
to the Lark. Now, it was not alone by the colonels testament, it was by his own
love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1375 felt himself restrained. This frightful situation, which had
already lasted above half an hour, was changing its aspect every moment. Marius
had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most
heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none. The tumult of his
thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den. In the midst of this
silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut
again. The prisoner made a movement in his bonds. Heres the bourgeoise, said
Thenardier. He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thenardier woman did in
fact rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes,
and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously False
address! The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and
picked up his axe again. She resumed Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17,
no Monsieur Urbain Fabre! They know not what it means! She paused, choking,
then went on Monsieur Thenardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too
good, you see! If it had been me, Id have chopped the beast in four quarters to
begin with! And if he had acted ugly, Id have boiled him alive! He would have
been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where he keeps his
shiners! Thats the way I should have managed matters! Peo- 1376 Les Miserables
ple are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women!
Nobody at No. 17. Its nothing but a big carriage gate! No Monsieur Fabre in the
Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all!
I spoke to both the porter and the portress, a fine, stout woman, and they know
nothing about him! Marius breathed freely once more. She, Ursule or the Lark,
he no longer knew what to call her, was safe. While his exasperated wife
vociferated, Thenardier had seated himself on the table. For several minutes he
uttered not a word, but swung his right foot, which hung down, and stared at
the brazier with an air of savage revery. Finally, he said to the prisoner,
with a slow and singularly ferocious tone A false address? What did you expect
to gain by that? To gain time! cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at
the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut. The prisoner was only
attached to the bed now by one leg. Before the seven men had time to collect
their senses and dash forward, he had bent down into the fireplace, had
stretched out his hand to the brazier, and had then straightened himself up
again, and now Thenardier, the female Thenardier, and the ruffians, huddled in
amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as
almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the
red-hot chisel, which emitted a threaten- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1377
ing glow. The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house
eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut and
worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the police made
their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels of industry, which
are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the
shadows, marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape. These
hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers work what the
metaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys,
just as there are Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to
deliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled
knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without
affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in
such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed together
and unscrewed at will it is a box. In this box he hides a watchspring, and this
watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The
unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all, he
possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during the subsequent
search of the police, was found under the bed near the window. They also found
a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou. It is probable that the
prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians
searched him, that he contrived to conceal it in his hand, and that afterward,
1378 Les Miserables having his right hand free, he unscrewed it, and used it as
a saw to cut the cords which fastened him, which would explain the faint noise
and almost imperceptible movements which Marius had observed. As he had not
been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he had not cut the bonds
of his left leg. The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise. Be easy,
said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. He still holds by one leg, and he cant get
away. Ill answer for that. I tied that paw for him. In the meanwhile, the
prisoner had begun to speak You are wretches, but my life is not worth the
trouble of defending it. When you think that you can make me speak, that you
can make me write what I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what
I do not choose to say He stripped up his left sleeve, and added See here. At
the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel which he held
in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh. The crackling of the
burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture
filled the hovel. Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered,
hardly a muscle of the old mans face contracted, and while the red-hot iron
sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on
Thenardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where
suffering vanished in serene majesty. With grand and lofty natures, the revolts
of the flesh and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1379 the senses when subjected
to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and make it appear on the
brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself.
Wretches! said he, have no more fear of me than I have for you! And, tearing
the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window, which had been left
open the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into the night, whirling as it
flew, and fell far away on the snow. The prisoner resumed Do what you please
with me. He was disarmed. Seize him! said Thenardier. Two of the ruffians laid
their hands on his shoulder, and the masked man with the ventriloquists voice
took up his station in front of him, ready to smash his skull at the slightest
movement. At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the
partition, but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy
conducted in a low tone There is only one thing left to do. Cut his throat. Thats
it. It was the husband and wife taking counsel together. Thenardier walked
slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took out the knife. Marius
fretted with the handle of his pistol. Unprecedented perplexity! For the last
hour he had had two voices in his conscience, the one enjoining him to respect
his fathers testament, the other 1380 Les Miserables crying to him to rescue
the prisoner. These two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which
tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he
should find some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the
limits of possibility had presented itself. However, the peril was urgent, the
last bounds of delay had been reached Thenardier was standing thoughtfully a
few paces distant from the prisoner. Marius cast a wild glance about him, the
last mechanical resource of despair. All at once a shudder ran through him. At
his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon illuminated
and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this paper he read the
following line written that very morning, in large letters, by the eldest of
the Thenardier girls THE BOBBIES ARE HERE. An idea, a flash, crossed Marius
mind this was the expedient of which he was in search, the solution of that
frightful problem which was torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving
the victim. He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the
sheet of paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the
paper round it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the
den. It was high time. Thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last
scruples, and was advancing on the prisoner. Something is falling! cried the
Thenardier woman. What is it? asked her husband. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1381 The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She
handed it to her husband. Where did this come from? demanded Thenardier.
Pardie! ejaculated his wife, where do you suppose it came from? Through the
window, of course. I saw it pass, said Bigrenaille. Thenardier rapidly unfolded
the paper and held it close to the candle. Its in Eponines handwriting. The
devil! He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the
line written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice Quick! The
ladder! Lets leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp! Without cutting that
mans throat? asked, the Thenardier woman. We havent the time. Through what?
resumed Bigrenaille. Through the window, replied Thenardier. Since Ponine has
thrown the stone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched
on that side. The mask with the ventriloquists voice deposited his huge key on
the floor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,
three times rapidly without uttering a word. This was the signal like the
signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship. The ruffians who were
holding the prisoner released him in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder
was unrolled out- 1382 Les Miserables side the window, and solidly fastened to
the sill by the two iron hooks. The prisoner paid no attention to what was
going on around him. He seemed to be dreaming or praying. As soon as the ladder
was arranged, Thenardier cried Come! the bourgeoise first! And he rushed
headlong to the window. But just as he was about to throw his leg over,
Bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar. Not much, come now, you old dog,
after us! After us! yelled the ruffians. You are children, said Thenardier, we
are losing time. The police are on our heels. Well, said the ruffians, lets
draw lots to see who shall go down first. Thenardier exclaimed Are you mad! Are
you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste time, do you? Draw lots,
do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! With written names! Thrown into a
hat! Would you like my hat? cried a voice on the threshold. All wheeled round.
It was Javert. He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with
a smile. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1383 CHAPTER XXI ONE SHOULD ALWAYS
BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS At nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had
gone into ambush himself between the trees of the Rue de la
Barrieredes-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the
boulevard. He had begun operations by opening his pockets, and dropping into it
the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to
the den. But he had only caged Azelma. As for Eponine, she was not at her post,
she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then Javert had
made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon. The
comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. At last, he had
grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nest there, sure of being in luck,
having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered, he had finally decided
to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot. It will be remembered that
he had Marius pass-key. 1384 Les Miserables He had arrived just in the nick of
time. The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had
abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a second,
these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in an attitude of
defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key, another with his
bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers. Thenardier had his knife
in his fist. The Thenardier woman snatched up an enormous paving-stone which
lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman. Javert
put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the room, with arms
folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath. Halt there, said he.
You shall not go out by the window, you shall go through the door. Its less
unhealthy. There are seven of you, there are fifteen of us. Dont lets fall to
collaring each other like men of Auvergne. Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which
he had kept concealed under his blouse, and put it in Thenardiers hand,
whispering in the latters ear Its Javert. I dont dare fire at that man. Do you
dare? Parbleu! replied Thenardier. Well, then, fire. Thenardier took the pistol
and aimed at Javert. Javert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently
at him and contented himself with saying Come now, dont fire. Youll miss fire.
Thenardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire. Didnt I tell you so!
ejaculated Javert. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1385 Bigrenaille flung his
bludgeon at Javerts feet. Youre the emperor of the fiends! I surrender. And
you? Javert asked the rest of the ruffians. They replied So do we. Javert began
again calmly Thats right, thats good, I said so, you are nice fellows. I only
ask one thing, said Bigrenaille, and that is, that I may not be denied tobacco
while I am in confinement. Granted, said Javert. And turning round and calling
behind him Come in now! A squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed
with bludgeons and cudgels, rushed in at Javerts summons. They pinioned the
ruffians. This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the
den with shadows. Handcuff them all! shouted Javert. Come on! cried a voice
which was not the voice of a man, but of which no one would ever have said It
is a womans voice. The Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the
angles of the window, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar. The
policemen and agents recoiled. She had thrown off her shawl, but retained her
bonnet her husband, who was crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the
discarded shawl, and she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the
paving-stone above 1386 Les Miserables her head with the gesture of a giantess
on the point of hurling a rock. Beware! she shouted. All crowded back towards
the corridor. A broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret. The
Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be
pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents The cowards! Javert smiled,
and advanced across the open space which the Thenardier was devouring with her
eyes. Dont come near me, she cried, or Ill crush you. What a grenadier!
ejaculated Javert youve got a beard like a man, mother, but I have claws like a
woman. And he continued to advance. The Thenardier, dishevelled and terrible,
set her feet far apart, threw herself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at
Javerts head. Javert ducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind,
knocked off a huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle
across the hovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javerts feet. At the same
moment, Javert reached the Thenardier couple. One of his big hands descended on
the womans shoulder the other on the husbands head. The handcuffs! he shouted.
The policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javerts order had been
executed. The Thenardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, and
at those of her husband, who had dropped Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1387
to the floor, and exclaimed, weeping My daughters! They are in the jug, said
Javert. In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep
behind the door, and were shaking him He awoke, stammering Is it all over,
Jondrette? Yes, replied Javert. The six pinioned ruffians were standing, and
still preserved their spectral mien all three besmeared with black, all three
masked. Keep on your masks, said Javert. And passing them in review with a
glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdam parade, he said to the three
chimney-builders Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day,
Deuxmilliards! Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with
the meat-axe Good day, Gueulemer! And to the man with the cudgel Good day,
Babet! And to the ventriloquist Your health, Claquesous. At that moment, he
caught sight of the ruffians prisoner. who, ever since the entrance of the
police, had not uttered a word, and had held his head down. Untie the
gentleman! said Javert, and let no one go 1388 Les Miserables out! That said,
he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table, where the candle and
the writing-materials still remained, drew a stamped paper from his pocket, and
began to prepare his report. When he had written the first lines, which are
formulas that never vary, he raised his eyes Let the gentleman whom these
gentlemen bound step forward. The policemen glanced round them. Well, said
Javert, where is he? The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre,
the father of Ursule or the Lark, had disappeared. The door was guarded, but
the window was not. As soon as he had found himself released from his bonds,
and while Javert was drawing up his report, he had taken advantage of
confusion, the crowd, the darkness, and of a moment when the general attention
was diverted from him, to dash out of the window. An agent sprang to the
opening and looked out. He saw no one outside. The rope ladder was still
shaking. The devil! ejaculated Javert between his teeth, he must have been the most
valuable of the lot. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1389 CHAPTER XXII THE
LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO On the day following that on which
these events took place in the house on the Boulevard de lHopital, a child, who
seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was
ascending the side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barriere de
Fontainebleau. Night had fully come. This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags,
with linen trousers in the month of February, and was singing at the top of his
voice. At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was
rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern the child
jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming Hello! And I took it for an
enormous, enormous dog! He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a
jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by
capitals an enormous, ENORMOUS dog. The old woman straightened herself up in a
fury. 1390 Les Miserables Nasty brat! she grumbled. If I hadnt been bending
over, I know well where I would have planted my foot on you. The boy was
already far away. Kisss! kisss! he cried. After that, I dont think I was
mistaken! The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright,
and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all hollowed
into angles and wrinkles, with crows-feet meeting the corners of her mouth. Her
body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One would have
pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light from the night. The
boy surveyed her. Madame, said he, does not possess that style of beauty which
pleases me. He then pursued his road, and resumed his song Le roi Coupdesabot
Sen allait a la chasse, A la chasse aux corbeaux At the end of these three
lines he paused. He had arrived in front of No. 50-52, and finding the door
fastened, he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks, which
betrayed rather the mans shoes that he was wearing than the childs feet which
he owned. In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the
corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering clamorous
cries and in- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1391 dulging in lavish and exaggerated
gestures. Whats this? Whats this? Lord God! Hes battering the door down! Hes
knocking the house down. The kicks continued. The old woman strained her lungs.
Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays? All at once she paused. She had
recognized the gamin. What! so its that imp! Why, its the old lady, said the
lad. Good day, Bougonmuche. I have come to see my ancestors. The old woman
retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderful improvisation of hatred
taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness, which was, unfortunately, wasted
in the dark Theres no one here. Bah! retorted the boy, wheres my father? At La
Force. Come, now! And my mother? At Saint-Lazare. Well! And my sisters? At the
Madelonettes. The lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Maam Bougon,
and said Ah! Then he executed a pirouette on his heel a moment later, the old
woman, who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young
voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind 1392 Les
Miserables Le roi Coupdesabot Sen allait a la chasse, A la chasse aux corbeaux,

PAGES OF HISTORY Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1395 CHAPTER I WELL CUT 1831
and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the Revolution of
July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history. These two
years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those
which follow them. They have a revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be
distinguished there. The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the
solid group of superposed and adhering interests, the centuryold profiles of
the ancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant,
athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. These
appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance.
At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descried shining
there. This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be
sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even
at the present day. We shall make the attempt. The Restoration had been one of
those intermediate phases, hard to define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing,
1396 Les Miserables murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which are nothing else than the
arrival of a great nation at a halting-place. These epochs are peculiar and
mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit. In the beginning,
the nation asks nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing, peace it has
but one ambition, to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil.
Of great events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have
seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would exchange
Caesar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. What a good little
king was he! We have marched since daybreak, we have reached the evening of a
long and toilsome day we have made our first change with Mirabeau, the second
with Robespierre, the third with Bonaparte we are worn out. Each one demands a
bed. Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are
sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what? A
shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of tranquillity, of
leisure behold, they are content. But, at the same time certain facts arise,
compel recognition, and knock at the door in their turn. These facts are the
products of revolutions and wars, they are, they exist, they have the right to
install themselves in society, and they do install themselves therein and most
of the time, facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do
nothing but prepare lodgings for principles. 32 In olden times, fouriers were
the officials who preceded the Court and allotted the lodgings. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1397 This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians At
the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demand
guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men. This is
what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector this is what France
demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire. These guarantees are a necessity of
the times. They must be accorded. Princes grant them, but in reality, it is the
force of things which gives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know,
which the Stuarts did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even
obtain a glimpse of in 1814. The predestined family, which returned to France
when Napoleon fell, had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself
which bestowed, and that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the
House of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, and
that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. was merely a
branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of Bourbon and graciously
given to the people until such day as it should please the King to reassume it.
Still, the House of Bourbon should have felt, from the displeasure created by
the gift, that it did not come from it. This house was churlish to the
nineteenth century. It put on an ill-tempered look at every development of the
nation. To make use of a trivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true
word, it looked glum. The people saw this. 1398 Les Miserables It thought it
possessed strength because the Empire had been carried away before it like a
theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that it had, itself, been brought
in in the same fashion. It did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which
had removed Napoleon. It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It
was mistaken it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The
roots of French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.
These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family, but the
history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the throne. The House
of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in her history, but
was no longer the principal element of her destiny, and the necessary base of
her politics. She could get along without the Bourbons she had done without
them for two and twenty years there had been a break of continuity they did not
suspect the fact. And how should they have suspected it, they who fancied that
Louis XVII. reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning
at the battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been
so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which
facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension here below which is
called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high. A
capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the guarantees
granted in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them. Sad. A sad thing! What
it termed its concessions were our conquests what it termed our en- Free eBooks

it to have come, the Restoration, supposing itself victorious over Bonaparte
and well-rooted in the country, that is to say, believing itself to be strong
and deep, abruptly decided on its plan of action, and risked its stroke. One
morning it drew itself up before the face of France, and, elevating its voice,
it contested the collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty,
of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation that which
made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a citizen. This is the
foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinances of July. The
Restoration fell. It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely
hostile to all forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it
alongside. Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm
discussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur in
peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and strong had
offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. The Revolution
had had the word under Robespierre the cannon had had the word under Bonaparte
it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. that it was the turn of intelligence
to have the word. The wind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the
lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent,
useful, and charming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great
principles which are so old for the thinker, so new for the 1400 Les Miserables
statesman, could be seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square
equality before the law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of
the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it
proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which
broke in the hands of Providence. The fall of the Bourbons was full of
grandeur, not on their side, but on the side of the nation. They quitted the
throne with gravity, but without authority their descent into the night was not
one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history it
was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of Napoleon.
They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and retained no aureole.
They were worthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in a certain measure,
the majesty of their misfortune. Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg,
causing a round table to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more
anxious about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This
diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who
honored their race. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one
morning with weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the
possession of so much force that it did not go into a rage. It defended itself,
restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to law, the
Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king Charles X. from
beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and set him gently on the
ground. It touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution. It
was Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1401 not one man, it was not a few men, it
was France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her victory,
who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice, before the eyes
of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du Vair after the day of the
Barricades It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the
great, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflicted fortune
to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their Prince in his
adversity but as for me, the fortune of my Kings and especially of my afflicted
Kings, will always be venerable to me. The Bourbons carried away with them
respect, but not regret. As we have just stated, their misfortune was greater
than they were. They faded out in the horizon. The Revolution of July instantly
had friends and enemies throughout the entire world. The first rushed toward
her with joy and enthusiasm, the others turned away, each according to his
nature. At the first blush, the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut
their eyes, wounded and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright
which can be comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange
revolution had hardly produced a shock it had not even paid to vanquished
royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the
eyes of despotic governments, who are always interested in having liberty
calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of being
formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted or plotted
against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the most trembling,
saluted it 1402 Les Miserables whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a
mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the
collaboration of some one who is working above man. The Revolution of July is
the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A thing which is full of splendor.
Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of 1830,
hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of being violent. Right
is the just and the true. The property of right is to remain eternally
beautiful and pure. The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even
when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact,
and if it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly
destined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps, even
monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of hideousness
the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries, let him look at
Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable
and cowardly writer he is nothing but the fact. And he is not only the Italian
fact he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. He seems
hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.
This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of
society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane
reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact and the fact
into right, that is the task of sages. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1403
CHAPTER II BADLY SEWED But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever
men is another. The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt. As soon as a
revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck.
The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of Statesmen
so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word.
It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there is nothing but skill,
there is necessarily pettiness. To say the skilful amounts to saying the
mediocre. In the same way, to say statesmen is sometimes equivalent to saying
traitors. If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like the
Revolution of July are severed arteries a prompt ligature is indispensable. The
right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right once firmly fixed, the
state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to
power. Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they
begin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what is
power? In the second, whence comes 1404 Les Miserables it? The skilful do not
seem to hear the murmured objection, and they continue their manoeuvres.
According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask of
necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people after a
revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical continent, is to
procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time
to dress our wounds, and to repair the house, can be had after a revolution.
The dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not
always easy to procure a dynasty. If it is absolutely necessary, the first man
of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the
manufacturing of a king. You have, in the first case, Napoleon in the second,
Iturbide. But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a
dynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in a
race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised. If we place
ourselves at the point of view of the statesmen, after making all allowances,
of course, after a revolution, what are the qualities of the king which result
from it? He may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary that is to
say, a participant in his own person in that revolution, that he should have
lent a hand to it, that he should have either compromised or distinguished
himself therein, that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in
it. What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national that is to say,
revolutionary at a distance, not through Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1405
acts committed, but by reason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past
and be historic be composed of future and be sympathetic. All this explains why
the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man, Cromwell or
Napoleon and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family, the House
of Brunswick or the House of Orleans. Royal houses resemble those Indian
fig-trees, each branch of which, bending over to the earth, takes root and
becomes a fig-tree itself. Each branch may become a dynasty. On the sole
condition that it shall bend down to the people. Such is the theory of the
skilful. Here, then, lies the great art to make a little render to success the
sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it
also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment the curve of the
transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull that aurora, to denounce
and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to cut all angles and nails, to wad
triumph, to muffle up right, to envelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put
it to bed very speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put
Hercules on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the
expedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out
with a potion, to take ones precautions against too much success, to garnish
the revolution with a shade. 1830 practised this theory, already applied to
England by 1688. 1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, 1406
Les Miserables quasi-right. Now, logic knows not the almost, absolutely as the
sun knows not the candle. Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?
Why? Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction.
Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will be
satiety. The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after
Charles X. The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the
bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people. The
bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair is not a caste. But
through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march of the
human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie. One is not a
class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is not one of the
divisions of the social order. Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The
state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired
after the shock of 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with
indifference and laziness, and which contains a little shame it was not the
slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams it was
the halt. The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost
contradictory sense a troop on the march, that is to say, movement a stand,
that is to say, repose. The halt is the restoration of forces it is repose
armed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1407 and on the alert it is the
accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard. The halt
presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to-morrow. It is the
partition between 1830 and 1848. What we here call combat may also be
designated as progress. The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen,
required a man who should express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A
composite individuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in
other terms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past
with the future. This man was already found. His name was Louis Philippe
dOrleans. The 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.
He called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took the place of
the Cathedral of Rheims. This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne
was the work of 1830. When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their
solution became apparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of
absolute right. Absolute right cried I protest! then, terrible to say, it
retired into the darkness. 1408 Les Miserables CHAPTER III LOUIS PHILIPPE
Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly and choose
well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a
junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearly always retain
sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss. Their
eclipse is never an abdication. Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly
revolutions also may be deceived, and grave errors have been seen. Let us return
to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the establishment which
entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short, the King
amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was a rare man. The son of a
father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances, but also
as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame possessing all private
virtues and many public virtues careful of his health, of his fortune, of his
person, of his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the value
of a year sober, serene, peaceable, patient a good man and a good prince
sleeping with his wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1409 with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois,
an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become useful after
the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages
of Europe, and, what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and
speaking them an admirable representative of the middle class, but outstripping
it, and in every way greater than it possessing excellent sense, while
appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his
intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race, very particular, declaring
himself Orleans and not Bourbon thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal
while he was still only a Serene Highness, but a frank bourgeois from the day
he became king diffuse in public, concise in private reputed, but not proved to
be a miser at bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their
own fancy or duty lettered, but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman, but
not a chevalier simple, calm, and strong adored by his family and his household
a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by
immediate interest, always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor
and of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever
in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious
unanimities which mutter dully under thrones unreserved, sometimes imprudent in
his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in
expedients, in countenances, in masks making France fear Europe and Europe
France! Incontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family assuming
more 1410 Les Miserables domination than authority and more authority than
dignity, a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns everything
to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but
which has this valuable side, that it preserves politics from violent shocks,
the state from fractures, and society from catastrophes minute, correct,
vigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable contradicting himself at times
and giving himself the lie bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against
England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard singing the

intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not with
divination not very attentive to minds, but knowing men, that is to say

can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences accepted by the
surface, but little in accord with France lower down extricating himself by
dint of tact governing too much and not enough his own first minister excellent
at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of
ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order and
organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the founder
and lawyer of a dynasty having something of Charlemagne and something of an
attorney in short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to
create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite of
the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of
his century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of
history had he loved glory but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of
what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful. Louis
Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained graceful not always
approved by the nation, he always was so by the masses he pleased. He had that
gift of charming. He lacked majesty he wore no crown, although a king, and no
white hair, although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his
habits to the new a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830
Louis Philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient
pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of
opinions modern he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote les Polonois, and he
pronounced 1412 Les Miserables les Hongrais. He wore the uniform of the
national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like
Napoleon. He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the
opera. Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers this made
a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went out with his
umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole. He
was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, something of a doctor he bled a postilion
who had tumbled from his horse Louis Philippe no more went about without his
lancet, than did Henri IV. without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this
ridiculous king, the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.
For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to be made
there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign, that which
accuses the King three columns which all give different totals. Democratic
right confiscated, progress becomes a matter of secondary interest, the
protests of the street violently repressed, military execution of
insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, the Rue Transnonain, the
counsels of war, the absorption of the real country by the legal country, on
half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons, these are the deeds
of royalty Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case
of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of
faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,these are the
doings of the reign the policy which was more do- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1413 mestic than national was the doing of the King. As will be seen,
the proper deduction having been made, the Kings charge is decreased. This is
his great fault he was modest in the name of France. Whence arises this fault?
We will state it. Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that
incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of
everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity, which is
displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their civil and
Austerlitz in their military tradition. Moreover, if we deduct the public
duties which require to be fulfilled first of all, that deep tenderness of
Louis Philippe towards his family was deserved by the family. That domestic
group was worthy of admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents.
One of Louis Philippes daughters, Marie dOrleans, placed the name of her race
among artists, as Charles dOrleans had placed it among poets. She made of her
soul a marble which she named Jeanne dArc. Two of Louis Philippes daughters
elicited from Metternich this eulogium They are young people such as are rarely
seen, and princes such as are never seen. This, without any dissimulation, and
also without any exaggeration, is the truth about Louis Philippe. To be Prince
Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of the Restoration and
the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which
becomes 1414 Les Miserables reassuring in governing power, therein lay the
fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830 never was there a more complete adaptation of
a man to an event the one entered into the other, and the incarnation took
place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he had in his favor that
great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had been proscribed, a wanderer,
poor. He had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest
princely domains in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At
Reichenau, he gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool
work and sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie
enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of
Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was the
companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette he had belonged to the
Jacobins club Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder Danton had said to him
Young man! At the age of four and twenty, in 93, being then M. de Chartres, he
had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so well named
that poor tyrant. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in
the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in
the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, the
public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, the alarming,
stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath, the
relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of those who condemned as well
as of the man condemned,he had looked on those things, he had contemplated that
giddiness Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1415 he had seen the centuries appear
before the bar of the Assembly-Convention he had beheld, behind Louis XVI.,
that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the terrible culprit, the
monarchy, rise through the shadows and there had lingered in his soul the respectful
fear of these immense justices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal
as the justice of God. The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious.
Its memory was like a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute.
One day, in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he
rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list of the
Constituent Assembly. Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he
reigned the press was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were
free. The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the
gnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the light.
History will do justice to him for this loyalty. Louis Philippe, like all
historical men who have passed from the scene, is to-day put on his trial by
the human conscience. His case is, as yet, only in the lower court. The hour
when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has not yet sounded for
him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king the
austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his
first verdict Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called
the 221 and 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution
and in 1416 Les Miserables any case, from the superior point of view where
philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen
above, except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic
principle in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of
man in the first place, the right of the people in the second, all is
usurpation but what we can say, even at the present day, that after making these
reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is considered,
Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view of human goodness,
will remain, to use the antique language of ancient history, one of the best
princes who ever sat on a throne. What is there against him? That throne. Take
away Louis Philippe the king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is
good at times even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his
gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the
continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with
fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a death sentence and
passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering it something to hold
his own against Europe, but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man
from the executioner. He obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper
of the seals he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against
the crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes
the pile of sentences covered his table he examined them all it was anguish to
him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to the same
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1417 witness to whom we have recently referred
I won seven last night. During the early years of his reign, the death penalty
was as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence
committed against the King. The Greve having disappeared with the elder branch,
a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the
Barriere-Saint-Jacques practical men felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate
guillotine and this was one of the victories of Casimir Perier, who represented
the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its
liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the
Fieschi machine, he exclaimed What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I might
have pardoned! On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by his
ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is one of the
most generous figures of our day His pardon is granted it only remains for me
to obtain it. Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as Henri
IV. Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls, the
man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great. Louis
Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, by others, it
is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present day, who knew
that king, should come and testify in his favor before history this deposition,
whatever else it may be, is evidently and above all things, entirely
disinterested an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere one shade may console
another shade the 1418 Les Miserables sharing of the same shadows confers the
right to praise it it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of
two tombs in exile This one flattered the other. Free eBooks at Planet

drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of
one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of Louis Philippes reign,
it was necessary that there should be no equivoque, and it became requisite
that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king. Louis
Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence,
without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a revolutionary change,
evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the Revolution, but in which he,
the Duc dOrleans, exercised no personal initiative. He had been born a Prince,
and he believed himself to have been elected King. He had not served this
mandate on himself he had not taken it it had been offered to him, and he had
accepted it convinced, wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that
the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in
accordance with duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say 1420
Les Miserables it in good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in
perfect good faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the
amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the King
nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of elements. The
ocean defends the water, the hurricane defends the air, the King defends
Royalty, the democracy defends the people the relative, which is the monarchy,
resists the absolute, which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict,
but that which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety
later on and, in any case, those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two
parties is evidently mistaken the right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on
two shores at once, with one foot on the republic, and one in Royalty it is
indivisible, and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a
blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, then,
impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions. Whatever
the nature of these tempests may be, human irresponsibility is mingled with
them. Let us complete this exposition. The government of 1840 led a hard life
immediately. Born yesterday, it was obliged to fight to-day. Hardly installed,
it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the
apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking in solidity. Resistance was
born on the morrow perhaps even, it was born on the preceding evening. From
month to month the hostility increased, and from being concealed it became Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1421 patent. The Revolution of July, which gained
but little acceptance outside of France by kings, had been diversely
interpreted in France, as we have said. God delivers over to men his visible
will in events, an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately
make translations of it translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps,
and of nonsense. Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most
sagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they
arrive with their text, the task has long been completed there are already
twenty translations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party,
and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone
has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the light. Power itself
is often a faction. There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the
current they are the old parties. For the old parties who clung to heredity by
the grace of God, think that revolutions, having sprung from the right to
revolt, one has the right to revolt against them. Error. For in these
revolutions, the one who revolts is not the people it is the king. Revolution
is precisely the contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome,
contains within itself its legitimacy, which false revolutionists sometimes
dishonor, but which remains even when soiled, which survives even when stained
with blood. Revolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. A
revolution is a return from the fictitious to the 1422 Les Miserables real. It
is because it must be that it is. None the less did the old legitimist parties
assail the Revolution of 1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false
reasoning. Errors make excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its
vulnerable spot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic they attacked
this revolution in its royalty. They shouted to it Revolution, why this king?
Factions are blind men who aim correctly. This cry was uttered equally by the
republicans. But coming from them, this cry was logical. What was blindness in
the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted
the people. The enraged democracy reproached it with this. Between the attack
of the past and the attack of the future, the establishment of July struggled.
It represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical
centuries, on the other hand with eternal right. In addition, and beside all
this, as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy, 1830 was
obliged to take precedence of all Europe. To keep the peace, was an increase of
complication. A harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous
than a war. From this secret conflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was
born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness
of the European cabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty of July reared
up, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of European cabinets.
Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in France by
progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe. Free eBooks

Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education, penal
servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery, production,
consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights of capital, the
rights of labor, all these questions were multiplied above society, a terrible
slope. Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement became
manifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation. The
elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner, but quite as much.
Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people, traversed by
revolutionary currents, trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic
shocks. These dreamers, some isolated, others united in families and almost in
communion, turned over social questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive
miners, who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano,
hardly disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught
glimpses. This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this
agitated epoch. These men left to political parties the question of rights,
they occupied themselves with the question of happiness. The well-being of man,
that was what they wanted to extract from society. They raised material
questions, questions of agriculture, of industry, of commerce, almost to the
dignity of a religion. In civilization, such as it has formed itself, a little
by the 1424 Les Miserables command of God, a great deal by the agency of man,
interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard
rock, in accordance with a dynamic law, patiently studied by economists, those
geologists of politics. These men who grouped themselves under different
appellations, but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists,
endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters
of human felicity. From the question of the scaffold to the question of war,
their works embraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the
French Revolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.
The reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do not here treat
in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, the questions raised
by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them. All the problems that
the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonic visions, revery and mysticism
being cast aside, can be reduced to two principal problems. First problem To
produce wealth. Second problem To share it. The first problem contains the question
of work. The second contains the question of salary. In the first problem the
employment of forces is in question. In the second, the distribution of
enjoyment. From the proper employment of forces results public power. From a
good distribution of enjoyments results individ- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1425 ual happiness. By a good distribution, not an equal but an
equitable distribution must be understood. From these two things combined, the
public power without, individual happiness within, results social prosperity.
Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.
England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth admirably,
she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on one side only leads
her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness. All
enjoyments for some, all privations for the rest, that is to say, for the
people privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, born from toil itself. A
false and dangerous situation, which sates public power or private misery,
which sets the roots of the State in the sufferings of the individual. A badly
constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into
which no moral element enters. Communism and agrarian law think that they solve
the second problem. They are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal
partition abolishes emulation and consequently labor. It is a partition made by
the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is therefore impossible to pause
over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is not the same thing as
dividing it. The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved.
The two problems must be combined and made but one. Solve only the first of the
two problems you will be 1426 Les Miserables Venice, you will be England. You
will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, like England, a material power
you will be the wicked rich man. You will die by an act of violence, as Venice
died, or by bankruptcy, as England will fall. And the world will allow to die
and fall all that is merely selfishness, all that does not represent for the
human race either a virtue or an idea. It is well understood here, that by the
words Venice, England, we designate not the peoples, but social structures the
oligarchies superposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations
always have our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will live again
England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, is immortal. That
said, we continue. Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect
the poor, suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble
by the strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making
his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust, mathematically and
fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with
the growth of childhood, and make of science the base of manliness, develop
minds while keeping arms busy, be at one and the same time a powerful people
and a family of happy men, render property democratic, not by abolishing it,
but by making it universal, so that every citizen, without exception, may be a
proprietor, an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words, learn how
to produce wealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once moral and
material greatness and you Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1427 will be worthy
to call yourself France. This is what socialism said outside and above a few
sects which have gone astray that is what it sought in facts, that is what it
sketched out in minds. Efforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts! These
doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen necessity for the
statesman to take philosophers into account, confused evidences of which we
catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to be created, which shall be in
accord with the old world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary
ideal, a situation in which it became necessary to use Lafayette to defend
Polignac, the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt, the
chambers and streets, the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around
him, his faith in the Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation
born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to
remain of his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people,
his own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there were
moments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by the
difficulties of being a king. He felt under his feet a formidable
disaggregation, which was not, nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being
more France than ever. Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade,
gradually drawing nearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over
ideas a shade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had been
hastily stifled was 1428 Les Miserables moving and fermenting. At times the
conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort
of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spirits trembled
in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm. The electric
tension was such that at certain instants, the first comer, a stranger, brought
light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again. At intervals, deep and dull
mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder
contained by the cloud. Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution
of July, the year 1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and
threatening. The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last
Prince de Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as
Paris did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince and giving
herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas, behind us the
demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in Portugal, the earth quaking
in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over Bologna, France treating Austria
sharply at Ancona, at the North no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer
nailing up Poland in her coffin, irritated glances watching France narrowly all
over Europe, England, a suspected ally, ready to give a push to that which was
tottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage sheltering
itself behind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys
erased from the Kings carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette
lessened, Laffitte ruined, Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Perier

political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of
the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil at
Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war in the two cities, the same glare of the
furnace a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people the South rendered
fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse de Berry in la Vendee, plots,
conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the sombre roar of tumult of events to
the sombre roar of ideas. 1430 Les Miserables CHAPTER V FACTS WHENCE HISTORY
SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES Towards the end of April, everything had
become aggravated. The fermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830,
petty partial revolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly
suppressed, but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlying
conflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could be caught
of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a possible
revolution. France kept an eye on Paris Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine. The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was
beginning its ebullition. The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although
the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave
and stormy. The government was there purely and simply called in question.
There people publicly discussed the question of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1431 fighting or of keeping quiet. There were back shops where workingmen were
made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm,
and that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy. This
engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop
assumed a sonorous tone, and said, You understand! You have sworn! Sometimes
they went up stairs, to a private room on the first floor, and there scenes
that were almost masonic were enacted. They made the initiated take oaths to
render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families. That was the
formula. In the tap-rooms, subversive pamphlets were read. They treated the
government with contempt, says a secret report of that time. Words like the
following could be heard there I dont know the names of the leaders. We folks
shall not know the day until two hours beforehand. One workman said There are
three hundred of us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred
and fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot. Another said I dont ask
for six months, I dont ask for even two. In less than a fortnight we shall be
parallel with the government. With twenty-five thousand men we can face them.
Another said I dont sleep at night, because I make cartridges all night. From
time to time, men of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats came and caused
embarrassment, and with the air of command, shook hands with the most
important, and then went away. They never stayed 1432 Les Miserables more than
ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone The plot is ripe,
the matter is arranged. It was murmured by all who were there, to borrow the
very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was such that
one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop We have no arms!
One of his comrades replied The soldiers have! thus parodying without being
aware of the fact, Bonapartes proclamation to the army in Italy When they had
anything of a more secret nature on hand, adds one report, they did not
communicate it to each other. It is not easy to understand what they could
conceal after what they said. These reunions were sometimes periodical. At
certain ones of them, there were never more than eight or ten persons present,
and they were always the same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the
room was so full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through
enthusiasm and passion others because it was on their way to their work. As
during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops
who embraced new-comers. Other expressive facts came to light. A man would
enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark Wine-merchant, the
revolution will pay what is due to you. Revolutionary agents were appointed in
a wine-shop facing the Rue de Charonne. The balloting was carried on in their
caps. Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in the
Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1433 of
arms formed of wooden broadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the
buttons were removed from the foils. A workman said There are twenty-five of
us, but they dont count on me, because I am looked upon as a machine. Later on,
that machine became Quenisset. The indefinite things which were brewing
gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off
her doorsteps said to another woman For a long time, there has been a strong
force busy making cartridges. In the open street, proclamation could be seen
addressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of these proclamations
was signed Burtot, wine-merchant. One day a man with his beard worn like a
collar and with an Italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a
liquor-seller in the Marche Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which
seemed to emanate from an occult power. Groups formed around him, and
applauded. The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and
noted down. Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, our
bill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.The breakdown which has
recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many mediums.The future of
nations is being worked out in our obscure ranks. Here are the fixed terms
action or reaction, revolution or counter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no
longer believe either in inertia or in immobility. For the people against the
people, that is the question. There is no other.On the day when we cease to
suit you, break us, but up to that day, help us to march on. All this in broad
1434 Les Miserables daylight. Other deeds, more audacious still, were
suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity. On the
4th of April, 1832, a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the
angle of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted I am a Babouvist! But beneath
Babeuf, the people scented Gisquet. Among other things, this man said Down with
property! The opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous. When it wants
to be on the right side, it preaches revolution, it is democratic in order to
escape being beaten, and royalist so that it may not have to fight. The
republicans are beasts with feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the
laboring classes. Silence, citizen spy! cried an artisan. This shout put an end
to the discourse. Mysterious incidents occurred. At nightfall, a workingman
encountered near the canal a very well dressed man, who said to him Whither are
you bound, citizen? Sir, replied the workingman, I have not the honor of your
acquaintance. I know you very well, however. And the man added Dont be alarmed,
I am an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quite faithful.
You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on you. Then he
shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying We shall meet again soon.
The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not only in
the wine-shops, but in the street. Get yourself received very soon, said a
weaver to a cab- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1435 inet-maker. Why? There is
going to be a shot to fire. Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable
replies, fraught with evident Jacquerie Who governs us? M. Philippe. No, it is
the bourgeoisie. The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word
Jacquerie in a bad sense. The Jacques were the poor. On another occasion two
men were heard to say to each other as they passed by We have a good plan of
attack. Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four
men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere du Trone
Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris any more.
Who was the he? Menacing obscurity. The principal leaders, as they said in the
faubourg, held themselves apart. It was supposed that they met for consultation
in a wine-shop near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug, chief of the
Society aid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving as
intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders, and
no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later
on by a man accused before the Court of Peers Who was your leader? 1436 Les
Miserables I knew of none and I recognized none. There was nothing but words,
transparent but vague sometimes idle reports, rumors, hearsay. Other
indications cropped up. A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence
around the ground on which a house was in process of construction, in the Rue
de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still
legible the following lines The committee must take measures to prevent
recruiting in the sections for the different societies. And, as a postscript We
have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, No. 5
bis, to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of a gunsmith in that
court. The section owns no arms. What excited the carpenter and caused him to
show this thing to his neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he
picked up another paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of
which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching to

of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four capital
letters quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs scouts, and the sense of
the letters u og a fe, which was a date, and meant April 15th, 1832. Under each
capital letter were inscribed names followed by very characteristic notes. Thus

bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance. It appears
that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth
arondissement of the Society of the Rights of Man, with the names and dwellings
of the chiefs of sections. To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are
nothing more than history, we may publish them. It should be added, that the
foundation of the Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to
the date when this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft. Still,
according to all the remarks and the words, according to written notes,
material facts begin to make their appearance. In the Rue Popincourt, in the
house of a dealer in bricabrac, there were seized seven sheets of gray paper,
all folded alike lengthwise and in four these sheets enclosed twenty-six
squares of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card,
on which was written the following Saltpetre   . . 12 ounces. Sulphur   .
. 2 ounces. Charcoal   . . 2 ounces and a half. Water   . . 2 ounces. The
report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell of powder.
A mason returning from his days work, left behind him a little package on a
bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1439 This
package was taken to the police station. It was opened, and in it were found
two printed dialogues, signed Lahautiere, a song entitled Workmen, band
together, and a tin box full of cartridges. One artisan drinking with a comrade
made the latter feel him to see how warm he was the other man felt a pistol
under his waistcoat. In a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise and the
Barriere du Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing,
discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a bag containing
a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges, a wooden
bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot
whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead. Police agents, making
their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five oclock in the morning, into the
dwelling of a certain Pardon, who was afterwards a member of the
Barricade-Merry section and got himself killed in the insurrection of April,
1834, found him standing near his bed, and holding in his hand some cartridges
which he was in the act of preparing. Towards the hour when workingmen repose,
two men were seen to meet between the Barriere Picpus and the Barriere
Charenton in a little lane between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of
which there was a Jeu de Siam.33 One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and
handed it to the other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the
perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp. He 1440 Les Miserables
primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan. Then
the two men parted. 33 A game of ninepins, in which one side of the ball is
smaller than the other, so that it does not roll straight, but describes a curve
on the ground. A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the
affair of April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and
twenty-four flints. The government one day received a warning that arms and two
hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On the
following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The remarkable
point about it was, that the police were not able to seize a single one. An
intercepted letter read The day is not far distant when, within four hours by
the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms. All this fermentation
was public, one might almost say tranquil. The approaching insurrection was
preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government. No singularity was
lacking to this still subterranean crisis, which was already perceptible. The
bourgeois talked peaceably to the working-classes of what was in preparation.
They said How is the rising coming along? in the same tone in which they would
have said How is your wife? A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired
Well, when are you going to make the attack? Another shop-keeper said The
attack will be made soon. I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand
of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1441 you, now there are twenty-five
thousand. He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he
was willing to sell for seven francs. Moreover, the revolutionary fever was
growing. Not a point in Paris nor in France was exempt from it. The artery was
beating everywhere. Like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations
and form in the human body, the network of secret societies began to spread all
over the country. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was
at the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of Man,
which also dated from one of the orders of the day Pluviose, Year 40 of the
republican era, which was destined to survive even the mandate of the Court of
Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which did not hesitate to bestow
on its sections significant names like the following Pikes. Tocsin. Signal
cannon. Phrygian cap. January 21. The beggars. The vagabonds. Forward march.
Robespierre. Level. Ca Ira. 1442 Les Miserables The Society of the Rights of
Man engendered the Society of Action. These were impatient individuals who
broke away and hastened ahead. Other associations sought to recruit themselves
from the great mother societies. The members of sections complained that they were
torn asunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization of
the Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press, for
individual liberty, for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes.
Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided into three fractions,
the levellers, the communists, the reformers. Then the Army of the Bastilles, a
sort of cohort organized on a military footing, four men commanded by a
corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant
there were never more than five men who knew each other. Creation where
precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius
of Venice. The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society
of Action, and the Army of the Bastilles. A legitimist association, the
Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about among these the republican affiliations.
It was denounced and repudiated there. The Parisian societies had ramifications
in the principal cities, Lyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its
Society of the Rights of Man, the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. All had a
revolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned
this word. In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1443 were no less moved than the faubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe
and the wine-shop of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques,
served as rallying points for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A
B C affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met,
as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembled also, as we
have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondetour which was
called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others were as public as possible,
and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an
interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions Where was this
meeting held? In the Rue de la Paix. At whose house? In the street. What
sections were there? Only one. Which? The Manuel section. Who was its leader?
I. You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking
the government. Where did your instructions come from? From the central
committee. The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved
subsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, and Epinard. They counted
on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on the
thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and in the
southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say, a pole surmounted
by a red cap. Such was the situation. The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any
other group of the population, as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this
situation and made it felt. That was the sore point. 1444 Les Miserables This
old faubourg, peopled like an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a
hive of bees, was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult.
Everything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption,
however, of the regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively
yet sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under
attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is particularly in the
matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet.
The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the
counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes, slack seasons, all
inherent to great political disturbances. In times of revolution misery is both
cause and effect. The blow which it deals rebounds upon it. This population
full of proud virtue, capable to the highest degree of latent heat, always
ready to fly to arms, prompt to explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to
be only awaiting the fall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon
chased by the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates
of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas. The wine-shops of the
Faubourg Antoine, which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which
the reader has just perused, possess historical notoriety. In troublous times
people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic
spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there, swelling hearts and
enlarging souls. The Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1445 cabarets of the
Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the
cave of the Sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taverns
where the tables were almost tripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the
sibylline wine. The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people.
Revolutionary agitations create fissures there, through which trickles the
popular sovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any
other but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as of the
blind cyclops, Ingens. In 93, according as the idea which was floating about
was good or evil, according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm,
there leaped forth from the Faubourg SaintAntoine now savage legions, now
heroic bands. Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who
in the early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with uplifted
bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what
did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end to
the sword, work for men, instruction for the child, social sweetness for the
woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread for all, the idea for all, the
Edenizing of the world. Progress and that holy, sweet, and good thing,
progress, they claimed in terrible wise, driven to extremities as they were,
half naked, club in fist, a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes but
the savages of civilization. They proclaimed right furiously they were
desirous, if only with fear and trembling, to force the human race to 1446 Les
Miserables paradise. They seemed barbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded
light with the mask of night. Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit,
and terrifying, but ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other
men, smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in
white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on a
velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanor and the
preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right, of fanaticism,
of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones
and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and the scaffold. For our part, if
we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the
civilized men of barbarism, we should choose the barbarians. But, thank Heaven,
still another choice is possible. No perpendicular fall is necessary, in front
any more than in the rear. Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress
with a gentle slope. God takes care of that. Gods whole policy consists in
rendering slopes less steep. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1447 CHAPTER VI
ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of
a possible catastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census. All were
present at a secret meeting at the Cafe Musain. Enjolras said, mixing his words
with a few half-enigmatical but significant metaphors It is proper that we
should know where we stand and on whom we may count. If combatants are
required, they must be provided. It can do no harm to have something with which
to strike. Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are
bulls on the road than when there are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little
on the herd. How many of us are there? There is no question of postponing this
task until to-morrow. Revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no
time to lose. Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared.
We must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast.
This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see the
polytechnic students. It is their 1448 Les Miserables day to go out. To-day is
Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere, will you not?
Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus. There is a perfect swarm and an
excellent one there. Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons
are growing lukewarm you will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de
Grenelle-Saint-Honore. Joly will go to Dupuytrens clinical lecture, and feel the
pulse of the medical school. Bossuet will take a little turn in the court and
talk with the young law licentiates. I will take charge of the Cougourde
myself. That arranges everything, said Courfeyrac. No. What else is there? A
very important thing. What is that? asked Courfeyrac. The Barriere du Maine,
replied Enjolras. Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in
reflection, then he resumed At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers,
painters, and journeymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic
family, but liable to cool off. I dont know what has been the matter with them
for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are becoming
extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is urgent need that some
one should go and talk with them a little, but with firmness. They meet at
Richefeus. They are to be found there between twelve and one oclock. Those
ashes must be fanned into a glow. For that errand I had counted on that
abstracted Marius, who is a good fellow on the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1449 whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for the Barriere du
Maine. I have no one. What about me? said Grantaire. Here am I. You? I. You
indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name
of principle! Why not? Are you good for anything? I have a vague ambition in
that direction, said Grantaire. You do not believe in everything. I believe in
you. Grantaire will you do me a service? Anything. Ill black your boots. Well,
dont meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from your absinthe. You are
an ingrate, Enjolras. You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine! You capable
of it! I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres, of crossing the Place
Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking the Rue
de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rue dAssas, of
reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre,
of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries, of striding across the boulevard, of
following the Chaussee du Maine, of passing the barrier, and entering
Richefeus. I am capable of that. My shoes are capable of that. 1450 Les
Miserables Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeus? Not much.
We only address each other as thou. What will you say to them? I will speak to
them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles. You? I. But I dont
receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. I have read Prudhomme, I
know the Social Contract, I know my constitution of the year Two by heart. The
liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins. Do you
take me for a brute? I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The
Rights of Man, the sovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a
Hebertist. I can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch
in hand. Be serious, said Enjolras. I am wild, replied Grantaire. Enjolras
meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man who has taken a
resolution. Grantaire, he said gravely, I consent to try you. You shall go to
the Barriere du Maine. Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Cafe
Musain. He went out, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to
put on a Robespierre waistcoat. Red, said he as he entered, and he looked
intently at Enjolras. Then, with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the
two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast. And stepping up to
Enjolras, he whispered in his ear Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1451 Be easy.
He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed. A quarter of an hour later, the
back room of the Cafe Musain was deserted. All the friends of the A B C were
gone, each in his own direction, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had
reserved the Cougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave. Those members
of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the plain of Issy, in one
of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of Paris. As
Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in review in
his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When facts, the
premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest
complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new
births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the
future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at hand. The people were again taking
possession of right, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again
majestically taking possession of France and saying to the world The sequel
to-morrow! Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that
moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his
own mind, with Combeferres philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuillys
cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyracs dash, Bahorels smile, Jean Prouvaires
melancholy, Jolys science, Bossuets sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which
took fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result 1452
Les Miserables would answer to the effort. This was well. This made him think
of Grantaire. Hold, said he to himself, the Barriere du Maine will not take me
far out of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeus? Let us have a
look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on. One oclock was
striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras reached the Richefeu
smoking-room. He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the
door fall to and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with
tables, men, and smoke. A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted
by another voice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.
Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne table,
strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He was hammering the table
with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard Double-six. Fours. The pig! I
have no more. You are dead. A two. Six. Three. One. Its my move. Four points.
Not much. Its your turn. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1453 I have made an
enormous mistake. You are doing well. Fifteen. Seven more. That makes me
twenty-two. Thoughtfully, Twentytwo! You werent expecting that double-six. If I
had placed it at the beginning, the whole play would have been changed. A two
again. One. One! Well, five. I havent any. It was your play, I believe? Yes.

SECOND.EPONINE Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1455 CHAPTER I THE LARKS MEADOW
Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track
he had set Javert but Javert had no sooner quitted the building, bearing off
his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than Marius also glided out of the
house. It was only nine oclock in the evening. Marius betook himself to
Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin
Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie for political reasons
this quarter was one where, at that epoch, insurrection liked to install
itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac I have come to sleep with you. Courfeyrac
dragged a mattress off his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on
the floor, and said There. At seven oclock on the following morning, Marius
returned to the hovel, paid the quarters rent which he owed to Maam Bougon, had
his books, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a
hand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javert
returned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning Marius as
to the events of the preceding evening, he found 1456 Les Miserables only Maam
Bougon, who answered Moved away! Maam Bougon was convinced that Marius was to
some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before.
Who would ever have said it? she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, a
young man like that, who had the air of a girl! Marius had two reasons for this
prompt change of residence. The first was, that he now had a horror of that
house, where he had beheld, so close at hand, and in its most repulsive and
most ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more
terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he
did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability, and
be brought in to testify against Thenardier. Javert thought that the young man,
whose name he had forgotten, was afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even
returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him,
however, but without success. A month passed, then another. Marius was still
with Courfeyrac. He had learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual
frequenter of the courts, that Thenardier was in close confinement. Every
Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerks office of La Force for
Thenardier. As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from
Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money.
These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac who lent and to
Thenardier who received them. To whom can they go? thought Courfeyrac. Whence
can this come to me? The- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1457 nardier asked
himself. Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a
trap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him his life was again
buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld very
close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he loved, the old man who
seemed to be her father, those unknown beings, who were his only interest and
his only hope in this world and, at the very moment when he thought himself on
the point of grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a
spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of
collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he
thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And
what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police?
The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the
Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that that workingman and
M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had
his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he
fled? Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short,
the man whom Thenardier thought that he recognized? Thenardier might have been
mistaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true,
detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg.
Heart-rending distress Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night over his
eyes. He was thrust onward, he 1458 Les Miserables was drawn, and he could not
stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and
the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also
a little, and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even heard
these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself What if I were to go
to such a place? What if I were to try such and such a thing? The girl whom he
could no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned Marius in
what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two
words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again he
still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it. To crown all, his poverty
had returned. He felt that icy breath close to him, on his heels. In the midst
of his torments, and long before this, he had discontinued his work, and
nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes.
A habit which is easy to get rid of, and difficult to take up again. A certain
amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses. It lulls to
sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes severe, and produces
in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of
pure thought, fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the
angles of the ideas. But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the
brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery! He
thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after
all, it is the same thing. Error! Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1459 Thought
is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. To replace thought
with revery is to confound a poison with a food. Marius had begun in that way,
as the reader will remember. Passion had supervened and had finished the work
of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom. One no longer
emerges from ones self except for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle
production. Tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor
diminishes, needs increase. This is a law. Man, in a state of revery, is
generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close
bounds. There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if
enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor man who
is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources are exhausted,
needs crop up. Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as
well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of
two holds, suicide or crime. By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes
when one goes out to throw ones self in the water. Excess of revery breeds men
like Escousse and Lebras. Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace,
with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just
written seems strange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being
kindles in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared, the more it
beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of
the inner night. Shethat was Marius whole thought. 1460 Les Miserables He
meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was
becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was growing old, that his
shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, that his boots were
giving out, and he said to himself If I could but see her once again before I
die! One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that her
glance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she did know
his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place, she still
loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was
thinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced
by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons for anything but sadness
and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to himself It is her thoughts
that are coming to me! Then he added Perhaps my thoughts reach her also. This
illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was sufficient,
nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope, into his soul.
From time to time, especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing
to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the most impersonal, the most ideal
of the reveries which filled his brain, to fall upon a notebook which contained
nothing else. He called this writing to her. It must not be supposed that his
reason was deranged. Quite the contrary. He had lost the faculty of working and
of moving firmly towards any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more
clear-sightedness and rectitude than ever. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1461
Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, what passed before
his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and men he pronounced a just
criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid
disinterestedness. His judgment, which was almost wholly disassociated from
hope, held itself aloof and soared on high. In this state of mind nothing
escaped him, nothing deceived him, and every moment he was discovering the
foundation of life, of humanity, and of destiny. Happy, even in the midst of
anguish, is he to whom God has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness!
He who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this
double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true. The soul which
loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity. However, day followed day, and nothing
new presented itself. It merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which
still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant.
He thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless
abyss. What! he repeated to himself, shall I not see her again before then!
When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one side and
followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach the Rue de la
Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little while before arriving at the little
river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in
the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of 1462 Les Miserables Paris,
where Ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down. There is something indescribable
there which exhales grace, a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines,
from which flutter rags drying in the wind, and an old market-gardeners house,
built in the time of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer
windows, dilapidated palisades, a little water amid poplar-trees, women,
voices, laughter on the horizon the Pantheon, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the
Val-de-Grace, black, squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, and in the
background, the severe square crests of the towers of Notre Dame. As the place
is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart or wagoner passes in
a quarter of an hour. It chanced that Marius solitary strolls led him to this
plot of ground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard,
a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the
place, asked this passer-byWhat is the name of this spot? The person replied It
is the Larks meadow. And he added It was here that Ulbach killed the
shepherdess of Ivry. But after the word Lark Marius heard nothing more. These
sudden congealments in the state of revery, which a single word suffices to
evoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea, and
it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else. The Lark was the
appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths of Marius melancholy.Stop,

Planet eBook.com 1463 terious asides, this is her meadow. I shall know where
she lives now. It was absurd, but irresistible. And every day he returned to
that meadow of the Lark. 1464 Les Miserables CHAPTER II EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF
CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS Javerts triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed
complete, but had not been so. In the first place, and this constituted the
principal anxiety, Javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated
man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that
this personage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would be
no less fine a prize for the authorities. And then, Montparnasse had escaped
Javert. Another opportunity of laying hands on that devils dandy must be waited
for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Eponine as she stood on the watch
under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off, preferring to play
Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes with the father. It was
well that he did so. He was free. As for Eponine, Javert had caused her to be seized
a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1465 mediocre consolation. Eponine had joined
Azelma at Les Madelonettes. And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to
La Force, one of the principal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not
known how this had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants could not
understand it at all. He had converted himself into vapor, he had slipped
through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage,
the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled all that they were able to say was,
that on arriving at the prison, there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies or
the police had had a hand in it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a
snow-flake in water? Had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents?
Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he
concentric with infraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in
crime and his hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations,
and would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included
other inspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he, perhaps,
although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, and
Claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent. It is
an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be
on such intimate juggling terms with the night. These double-edged rascals do
exist. However that may be, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found again.
Javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this. As for Marius, that
booby of a lawyer, who had probably 1466 Les Miserables become frightened, and
whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached very little importance to him.
Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at any time. But was he a lawyer after all?
The investigation had begun. The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put
one of these men of the band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the
hope that he would chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue
du Petit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and the
eyes of the watchers were fixed on him. This name of Brujon is one of the
souvenirs of La Force. In that hideous courtyard, called the court of the
BatimentNeuf New Building, which the administration called the court
Saint-Bernard, and which the robbers called the Fosseaux-Lions The Lions Ditch,
on that wall covered with scales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level
with the roofs, near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel
of the ducal residence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians,
there could still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly carved
in the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature BRUJON, 1811. The
Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832. The latter, of whom the
reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau house, was a very cunning and very
adroit young spark, with a bewildered and plaintive air. It was in conse- Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1467 quence of this plaintive air that the
magistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne yard
than in close confinement. Robbers do not interrupt their profession because
they are in the hands of justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such
a trifle as that. To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning
on another crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and who
toil, none the less, on a new work in their studios. Brujon seemed to be
stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together
in front of the sutlers window in the Charlemagne yard, staring like an idiot
at the sordid list of prices which began with garlic, 62 centimes, and ended
with cigar, 5 centimes. Or he passed his time in trembling, chattering his
teeth, saying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and
twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant. All at once, towards the end of
February, 1832, it was discovered that Brujon, that somnolent fellow, had had
three different commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment,
not under his own name, but in the name of three of his comrades and they had
cost him in all fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention
of the prison corporal. Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff
of commissions posted in the convicts parlor, it was learned that the fifty
sous could be analyzed as follows three commissions one to the Pantheon, ten
sous one to Valde-Grace, fifteen sous and one to the Barriere de Grenelle, 1468
Les Miserables twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole tariff.
Now, at the Pantheon, at the Val-de-Grace, and at the Barriere de Grenelle were
situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers,
Kruideniers, alias Bizarre, Glorieux, an ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon
whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident. It was thought
that these men were members of Patron Minette two of those leaders, Babet and
Gueulemer, had been captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been
addressed, not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the
street, must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been
plotted. They were in possession of other indications they laid hand on the
three prowlers, and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of
Brujons machinations. About a week after these measures had been taken, one
night, as the superintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower
dormitory in the Batiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the boxthis
was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties
punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to
the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through the peep-hole of the
dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the
light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell
for a month, but they were not able to seize what he had written. The police
learned nothing further about it. What is certain is, that on the following
morning, a pos- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1469 tilion was flung from the
Charlemagne yard into the Lions Ditch, over the five-story building which
separated the two court-yards. What prisoners call a postilion is a pallet of
bread artistically moulded, which is sent into Ireland, that is to say, over
the roofs of a prison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology over England
from one land to another into Ireland. This little pellet falls in the yard.
The man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some
prisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, he forwards
the note to its destination if it is a keeper, or one of the prisoners secretly
sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys, the note is
taken to the office and handed over to the police. On this occasion, the
postilion reached its address, although the person to whom it was addressed
was, at that moment, in solitary confinement. This person was no other than
Babet, one of the four heads of Patron Minette. The postilion contained a roll
of paper on which only these two lines were written Babet. There is an affair
in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden. This is what Brujon had written the
night before. In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the
note on from La Force to the Salpetriere, to a good friend whom he had and who
was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of
her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected by the police,
though not yet arrested. This Magnon, 1470 Les Miserables whose name the reader
has already seen, had relations with the Thenardier, which will be described in
detail later on, and she could, by going to see Eponine, serve as a bridge
between the Salpetriere and Les Madelonettes. It happened, that at precisely
that moment, as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against
Thenardier in the matter of his daughters, Eponine and Azelma were released.
When Eponine came out, Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes,
handed her Brujons note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter. Eponine
went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden, observed the house,
spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to Magnon, who delivers in the
Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon transmitted to Babets mistress in the
Salpetriere. A biscuit, in the shady symbolism of prisons, signifies Nothing to
be done. So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in
the circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other on his
way from it Well? asked Brujon, the Rue P.? Biscuit, replied Babet. Thus did
the foetus of crime engendered by Brujon in La Force miscarry. This miscarriage
had its consequences, however, which were perfectly distinct from Brujons
programme. The reader will see what they were. Often when we think we are
knotting one thread, we are tying quite another. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1471 CHAPTER III APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF Marius no longer went to
see any one, but he sometimes encountered Father Mabeuf by chance. While Marius
was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar
stairs, and which lead to places without light, where the happy can be heard
walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on his side. The Flora of Cauteretz
no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigo had not been successful in the
little garden of Austerlitz, which had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could
cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless,
he did not become discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des
Plantes, with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo at his own
expense. For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the Flora. He had
reduced his breakfast to two eggs, and he left one of these for his old
servant, to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And often
his breakfast was his only meal. He no longer smiled with his infantile 1472
Les Miserables smile, he had grown morose and no longer received visitors.
Marius did well not to dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M.
Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man
passed each other on the Boulevard de lHopital. They did not speak, and only exchanged
a melancholy sign of the head. A heartbreaking thing it is that there comes a
moment when misery looses bonds! Two men who have been friends become two
chance passers-by. Royal the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his
books, his garden, or his indigo these were the three forms which happiness,
pleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his living. He
said to himself When I shall have made my balls of blueing, I shall be rich, I
will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop, I will put my Flora in vogue
again with trickery, plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and I
will buy, I know well where, a copy of Pierre de Medines Art de Naviguer, with
wood-cuts, edition of 1655. In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of
indigo, and at night he returned home to water his garden, and to read his
books. At that epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age. One evening he
had a singular apparition. He had returned home while it was still broad daylight.
Mother Plutarque, whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined
on a bone, on which a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he had
found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned stone post,
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1473 which took the place of a bench in his
garden. Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchardgardens, a sort
of large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch on the
ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in the hutch, but
there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,the remains of the winters
provision. M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid
of his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a
serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity rendered him
accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree. The first of
these books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, De linconstance des
Demons the other was a quarto by Mutor de la Rubaudiere, Sur les Diables de
Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bievre. This last-mentioned old volume interested
him all the more, because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by
goblins in former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and
to blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his
hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a magnificent
rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat, wind, and sun
without a drop of rain, had passed the stalks were bending, the buds drooping,
the leaves falling all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly
sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls. The old
man had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but
he rose, laid his books on the bench, and walked, 1474 Les Miserables all bent
over and with tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the
chain, he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned
round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded
with stars. The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man
beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised to be as
arid as the day had been. Stars everywhere! thought the old man not the tiniest
cloud! Not a drop of water! And his head, which had been upraised for a moment,
fell back upon his breast. He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky,
murmuring A tear of dew! A little pity! He tried again to unhook the chain of
the well, and could not. At that moment, he heard a voice saying Father Mabeuf,
would you like to have me water your garden for you? At the same time, a noise as
of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge, and he beheld emerging
from the shrubbery a sort of tall, slender girl, who drew herself up in front
of him and stared boldly at him. She had less the air of a human being than of
a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight. Before Father Mabeuf,
who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have said, quick to take alarm,
was able to reply Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1475 by a single syllable,
this being, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had
unhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled the
watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had bare feet and a
tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds distributing life
around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the leaves filled Father Mabeufs
soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now. The
first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She watered the
whole garden. There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths,
where her outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and with
her fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat. When she had finished, Father
Mabeuf approached her with tears in his eyes, and laid his hand on her brow.
God will bless you, said he, you are an angel since you take care of the
flowers. No, she replied. I am the devil, but thats all the same to me. The old
man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her response What a pity
that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do nothing for you! You can do
something, said she. What? Tell me where M. Marius lives. The old man did not
understand. What Monsieur Mar- 1476 Les Miserables ius? He raised his glassy
eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished. A young man who used
to come here. In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory. Ah! yes he
exclaimed. I know what you mean. Wait! Monsieur Mariusthe Baron Marius
Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives, or rather, he no longer lives,ah well, I dont
know. As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and he
continued Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes
in the direction of the Glaciere, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark. Go
there. It is not hard to meet him. When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up,
there was no longer any one there the girl had disappeared. He was decidedly
terrified. Really, he thought, if my garden had not been watered, I should
think that she was a spirit. An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to
him, and as he fell asleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that
fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea,
little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he
said to himself in a bewildered way In sooth, that greatly resembles what
Rubaudiere narrates of the goblins. Could it have been a goblin? Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1477 CHAPTER IV AN APPARITION TO MARIUS Some days after this
visit of a spirit to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning, it was on a Monday, the day
when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for ThenardierMarius
had put this coin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerks office, he
had gone to take a little stroll, in the hope that this would make him work on
his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he seated himself
before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation his
task at that epoch consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrel
between Germans, the Gans and Savigny controversy he took Savigny, he took
Gans, read four lines, tried to write one, could not, saw a star between him
and his paper, and rose from his chair, saying I shall go out. That will put me
in spirits. And off he went to the Larks meadow. There he beheld more than ever
the star, and less than ever Savigny and Gans. He returned home, tried to take
up his work again, and 1478 Les Miserables did not succeed there was no means
of re-knotting a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain then
he said to himself I will not go out to-morrow. It prevents my working. And he
went out every day. He lived in the Larks meadow more than in Courfeyracs
lodgings. That was his real address Boulevard de la Sante, at the seventh tree
from the Rue Croulebarbe. That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had
seated himself on the parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight
penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves. He was dreaming of Her.
And his meditation turning to a reproach, fell back upon himself he reflected
dolefully on his idleness, his paralysis of soul, which was gaining on him, and
of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him, to such a
point that he no longer even saw the sun. Nevertheless, athwart this painful
extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue, so feeble had
action become in him, and he had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart
this melancholy absorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard
behind him, beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the
Gobelins beating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering and
singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the careless
happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other, the sound of toil. What
caused him to meditate deeply, and almost reflect, were two cheerful sounds.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1479 All at once, in the midst of his dejected
ecstasy, he heard a familiar voice saying Come! Here he is! He raised his eyes,
and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning, the elder
of the Thenardier daughters, Eponine he knew her name now. Strange to say, she
had grown poorer and prettier, two steps which it had not seemed within her
power to take. She had accomplished a double progress, towards the light and
towards distress. She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so
resolutely entered his chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the
holes were larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice, the
same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, and vacillating
glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in her face that indescribably
terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to
wretchedness. She had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia
through having gone mad from the contagion of Hamlets madness, but because she
had slept in the loft of some stable. And in spite of it all, she was
beautiful. What a star art thou, O youth! In the meantime, she had halted in
front of Marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance, and something
which resembled a smile. She stood for several moments as though incapable of
speech. So I have met you at last! she said at length. Father 1480 Les
Miserables Mabeuf was right, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for
you! If you only knew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They
let me out! seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had
not reached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I have hunted
for you! These six weeks! So you dont live down there any more? No, said Marius.
Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those takedowns are disagreeable. You
cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats like this! A young man like you
ought to have fine clothes. Do you know, Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls
you Baron Marius, I dont know what. It isnt true that you are a baron? Barons
are old fellows, they go to the Luxembourg, in front of the chateau, where
there is the most sun, and they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I once carried
a letter to a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where
do you live now? Marius made no reply. Ah! she went on, you have a hole in your
shirt. I must sew it up for you. She resumed with an expression which gradually
clouded over You dont seem glad to see me. Marius held his peace she remained
silent for a moment, then exclaimed But if I choose, nevertheless, I could
force you to look glad! What? demanded Marius. What do you mean? Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1481 Ah! you used to call me thou, she retorted. Well, then, what
dost thou mean? She bit her lips she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to
some sort of inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision. So
much the worse, I dont care. You have a melancholy air, I want you to be
pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you smile and hear
you say Ah, well, thats good. Poor Mr. Marius! you know? You promised me that
you would give me anything I like Yes! Only speak! She looked Marius full in
the eye, and said I have the address. Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed
back to his heart. What address? The address that you asked me to get! She
added, as though with an effort The addressyou know very well! Yes! stammered
Marius. Of that young lady. This word uttered, she sighed deeply. Marius sprang
from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly.
Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where is it?
Come with me, she responded. I dont know the street or number very well it is
in quite the other direction from here, but I know the house well, I will take
you to it. 1482 Les Miserables She withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone
which could have rent the heart of an observer, but which did not even graze
Marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state Oh! how glad you are! A cloud
swept across Marius brow. He seized Eponine by the arm Swear one thing to me!
Swear! said she, what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear? And she
laughed. Your father! promise me, Eponine! Swear to me that you will not give
this address to your father! She turned to him with a stupefied air. Eponine!
How do you know that my name is Eponine? Promise what I tell you! But she did
not seem to hear him. Thats nice! You have called me Eponine! Marius grasped
both her arms at once. But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to
what I am saying to you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this
address that you know! My father! said she. Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. Hes
in close confinement. Besides, what do I care for my father! But you do not
promise me! exclaimed Marius. Let go of me! she said, bursting into a laugh,
how you do shake me! Yes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is
that to me? I will not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is
that it? Nor to any one? said Marius. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1483 Nor
to any one. Now, resumed Marius, take me there. Immediately? Immediately. Come
along. Ah! how pleased he is! said she. After a few steps she halted. You are following
me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead, and follow me so, without
seeming to do it. A nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like
me. No tongue can express all that lay in that word, woman, thus pronounced by
that child. She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more Marius joined
her. She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him By the way,
you know that you promised me something? Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that
he owned in the world was the five francs intended for Thenardier the father.
He took them and laid them in Eponines hand. She opened her fingers and let the
coin fall to the ground, and gazed at him with a gloomy air. I dont want your
money, said she. 1484 Les Miserables BOOK THIRD.THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1485 CHAPTER I THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET About
the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament of Paris
having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period the grand seignors
displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealed them, had a little
house built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is
now called Rue Plumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as
Combat des Animaux. This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion two
rooms on the ground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen down
stairs, a boudoir up stairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a
garden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about an acre
and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen by passers-by but behind
the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and at the end of the courtyard a
low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar, a sort of preparation
destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need. This 1486 Les Miserables
building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret
spring, with a long, narrow, paved winding corridor, open to the sky, hemmed in
with two lofty walls, which, hidden with wonderful art, and lost as it were
between garden enclosures and cultivated land, all of whose angles and detours
it followed, ended in another door, also with a secret lock which opened a
quarter of a league away, almost in another quarter, at the solitary extremity
of the Rue du Babylone. Through this the chief justice entered, so that even
those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that
the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and would
never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go to the Rue
Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate had been able to
make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property, and consequently,
without interference. Later on, he had sold in little parcels, for gardens and
market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining the corridor, and the proprietors
of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes,
and did not even suspect the long, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid
their flower-beds and their orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It
is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great
deal about the chief justice. The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of
Mansard, wainscoted and furnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside,
old-fashioned on the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had
something discreet, coquettish, and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1487 solemn
about it, as befits a caprice of love and magistracy. This house and corridor,
which have now disappeared, were in existence fifteen years ago. In 93 a
coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it, but had
not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt. So that it was the
house which demolished the coppersmith. After that, the house remained
uninhabited, and fell slowly to ruin, as does every dwelling to which the
presence of man does not communicate life. It had remained fitted with its old
furniture, was always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who
passed through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible
bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819. Towards the end of
the Restoration, these same passersby might have noticed that the bill had
disappeared, and even that the shutters on the first floor were open. The house
was occupied, in fact. The windows had short curtains, a sign that there was a
woman about. In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had
presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of
course, the back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He
had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired. The
house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnished with the
justices old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs, had added what
was lacking here and there, had replaced the paving-stones in the yard, bricks
in the floors, steps in the stairs, missing bits in the inlaid floors and the
glass in the lattice windows, and had finally installed him- 1488 Les
Miserables self there with a young girl and an elderly maid-servant, without
commotion, rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is
entering his own house. The neighbors did not gossip about him, for the reason
that there were no neighbors. This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the
young girl was Cosette. The servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean
Valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly,
a stammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decided Jean
Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the name of M.
Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has been related heretofore,
the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than Thenardier to recognize
Jean Valjean. Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the PetitPicpus? What
had happened? Nothing had happened. It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was
happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He
saw Cosette every day, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more
and more, he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she
was his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last
indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto gently
incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as
it was for him, that he should grow old there, and that she would grow up
there, that she would grow old there, and that he should die there Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1489 that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was
possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He interrogated
himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were really his, if it were not
composed of the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which he,
an old man, was confiscating and stealing if that were not theft? He said to
himself, that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to
deprive her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys,
under the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her
ignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation germinate
in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to God. And who
knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some day, and found herself a
nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate him? A last, almost selfish
thought, and less heroic than the rest, but which was intolerable to him. He
resolved to quit the convent. He resolved on this he recognized with anguish,
the fact that it was necessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years
sojourn between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed
or dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men. He had
grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognize him now? And
then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, and he had no right
to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to
the galleys. Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right? Finally,
nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions. 1490 Les
Miserables As for Cosettes education, it was almost finished and complete. His
determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not long in
presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died. Jean Valjean demanded an audience
with the revered prioress and told her that, having come into a little
inheritance at the death of his brother, which permitted him henceforth to live
without working, he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter
with him but that, as it was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the
vows, should have received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the
Reverend Prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as
indemnity, for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five
thousand francs. It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the
Perpetual Adoration. On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little
valise the key to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter
to touch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which
proceeded from it. Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him
more. He always had it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes,
that he carried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it,
and called this valise his inseparable, saying I am jealous of it.
Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound
anxiety. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1491 He discovered the house in the
Rue Plumet, and hid himself from sight there. Henceforth he was in the
possession of the name Ultime Fauchelevent. At the same time he hired two other
apartments in Paris, in order that he might attract less attention than if he
were to remain always in the same quarter, and so that he could, at need, take
himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short,
so that he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so
miraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor
in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote from each other, the
one in the Rue de lOuest, the other in the Rue de lHomme Arme. He went from
time to time, now to the Rue de lHomme Arme, now to the Rue de lOuest, to pass
a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint. He had himself served by the
porters, and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs, living on his
funds, and having a little temporary resting-place in town. This lofty virtue
had three domiciles in Paris for the sake of escaping from the police. 1492 Les
Miserables CHAPTER II JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD However, properly
speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had arranged his existence there
in the following fashion Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had
the big sleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the
gilded fillets, the justices drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vast
arm-chairs she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antique
damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue du
Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gauchers, put into Cosettes chamber, and, in order
to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with
this bric-a-brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable
to young girls, an etagere, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an
inkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl,
a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long
damask curtains with a red foundation and three col- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1493 ors, like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first
floor. On the ground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winter long,
Cosettes little house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the
sort of porters lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with
a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an
earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in one
corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he had a loaf of black
bread on the table for his own use. When Toussaint came, he had said to her It
is the young lady who is the mistress of this house.And you, monsieur?
Toussaint replied in amazement.I am a much better thing than the master, I am
the father. Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she
regulated their expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put
his arm through Cosettes and took her for a walk. He led her to the Luxembourg,
to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her to mass at
Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off. As it was a very
poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the poor people surrounded
him in church, which had drawn down upon him Thenardiers epistle To the
benevolent gentleman of the church of SaintJacques-du-Haut-Pas. He was fond of taking
Cosette to visit the poor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in
the Rue Plumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went
himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard. Their wood and wine
were put into a half- 1494 Les Miserables subterranean hollow lined with
rock-work which lay near the Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the
chief-justice as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and Little Houses no love
was without a grotto. In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a
box destined for the reception of letters and papers only, as the three
inhabitants of the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor
letters, the entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love
affair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the
taxcollectors notices, and the summons of the guard. For M. Fauchelevent,
independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard he had not been able to
escape through the fine meshes of the census of 1831. The municipal information
collected at that time had even reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort
of impenetrable and holy cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable
guise, and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall.
Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard
he did this willingly, however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with
every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had just attained his
sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over
fifty moreover, he had no desire to escape his sergeant-major nor to quibble
with Comte de Lobau he possessed no civil status, he was concealing his name,
he was concealing his identity, so he concealed his age, he concealed
everything and, as we have just said, he willingly did Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1495 his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition lay in
resembling any other man who paid his taxes. This man had for his ideal,
within, the angel, without, the bourgeois. Let us note one detail, however when
Jean Valjean went out with Cosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen,
and had the air of a retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally
at night, he was always dressed in a workingmans trousers and blouse, and wore
a cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility? Both. Cosette
was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, and hardly noticed her
fathers peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she venerated Jean Valjean, and
thought everything he did right. One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse
of Jean Valjean, said to her Thats a queer fish. She replied Hes a saint.
Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged except
by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the garden gate it
would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet. That gate
was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated, in order not
to attract attention. In this, possibly, he made a mistake. 1496 Les Miserables
CHAPTER III FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS The garden thus left to itself for more than
half a century had become extraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty
years ago halted to gaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid
in its fresh and verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often
allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of
that ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two green and
moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable
arabesque. There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues,
several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on the
wall, and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass everywhere.
Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned. Weeds abounded,
which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land. The festival of
gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothing in this garden obstructed the
sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them.
The trees had bent over towards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the
branch had inclined, that Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1497 which crawls on
the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air, that which
floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks,
boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, shoots, spines, thorns, had
mingled, crossed, married, confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a
deep and close embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under the
well-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet square,
the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity. This garden was
no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that is to say, something as
impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city, quivering like a nest, sombre
like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a
throng. In Floreal34 this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its
four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the
rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love,
and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to
the wind its enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on
the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement
of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty,
life, joy, perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there,
and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about
there in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a
throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the twittering
forgot to say the humming 1498 Les Miserables completed. In the evening, a
dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist, a calm
and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles
and convolvulus poured out from every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle
poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as
they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the
trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protect the
wings. 34 From April 19 to May 20. In winter the thicket was black, dripping,
bristling, shivering, and allowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers
on the branches and dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails
were visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion,
under any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this tiny
enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude, liberty, the
absence of man, the presence of God and the rusty old gate had the air of
saying This garden belongs to me. It was of no avail that the pavements of
Paris were there on every side, the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de
Varennes a couple of paces away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the
Chamber of Deputies not far off the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of
the Rue SaintDominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain

former propri- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1499 etors, the revolution which
had passed over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence,
forgetfulness, forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to
restore to this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds,
great crimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles,
uneasy and rapid insects to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth
and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage
grandeur and for nature, which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man, and
which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all, in the
ant as well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden
with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.
Nothing is small, in fact any one who is subject to the profound and
penetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolute satisfaction
is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the
effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by
these decompositions of force terminating in unity. Everything toils at
everything. Algebra is applied to the clouds the radiation of the star profits
the rose no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is
useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the course of a
molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the
fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely
great and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causes in the precipices
of being, 1500 Les Miserables and the avalanches of creation? The tiniest worm
is of importance the great is little, the little is great everything is
balanced in necessity alarming vision for the mind. There are marvellous
relations between beings and things in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun
to the grub, nothing despises the other all have need of each other. The light
does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing
what it is doing the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping
flowers. All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite.
Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the
peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level the birth of an
earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope
begins. Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of
mould is a pleiad of flowers a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. The same
promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, exists between the things of the
intelligence and the facts of substance. Elements and principles mingle,
combine, wed, multiply with each other, to such a point that the material and
the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is
perpetually returning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal
life goes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible
mystery of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream, not a
single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits a planet there,
oscillating and winding, making of light a force and of thought an element,
disseminated and invisible, dissolving all, except Free eBooks at Planet

Enormous gearing, the prime motor of which is the gnat, and whose final wheel

this garden, created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries, had been transformed
and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries. There were no longer either
arbors, or bowling greens, or tunnels, or grottos there was a magnificent,
dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over
into Eden. It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this
retreat wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. This
coquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had returned to virginity
and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman who thought that he
was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman who thought that he was a
continuation of Lenotre, had turned it about, cut, ruffled, decked, moulded it
to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more, had filled it with
shade, and had arranged it for love. There was, also, in this solitude, a heart
which was quite ready. Love had only to show himself he had here a temple
composed of verdure, grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated
branches, and a soul made of sweetness, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1503 of
faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration, and of illusion. Cosette had left the
convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen,
and she was at the ungrateful age we have already said, that with the exception
of her eyes, she was homely rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature,
but she was awkward, thin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in
short. Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught
religion, and even and above all, devotion then history, that is to say the
thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar, the participles,
the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing, etc. but in all other respects
she was utterly ignorant, which is a great charm and a great peril. The soul of
a young girl should not be left in the dark later on, mirages that are too
abrupt and too lively are formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be
gently and discreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than
with their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere half-light
which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is nothing but the
maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the
virgin and the experience of the woman, which knows how this half-light is to
be created and of what it should consist. Nothing supplies the place of this
instinct. All the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the
formation of a young girls soul. Cosette had had no mother. She had only had
many mothers, in the plural. 1504 Les Miserables As for Jean Valjean, he was,
indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew
nothing at all. Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of
preparing a woman for life, what science is required to combat that vast
ignorance which is called innocence! Nothing prepares a young girl for passions
like the convent. The convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the
unknown. The heart, thus thrown back upon itself, works downward within itself,
since it cannot overflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence
visions, suppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for adventures,
fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the
mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement
as soon as the open gate permits them to enter. The convent is a compression
which, in order to triumph over the human heart, should last during the whole
life. On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and
more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuation of
solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed, but a nature
that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant the same dreams as in the
convent, but with glimpses of young men a grating, but one that opened on the
street. Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean
Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her. Do what you like with it, he
said to her. This amused Cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the
stones, she Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1505 hunted for beasts she played
in it, while awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden
for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, while awaiting
the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the
boughs above her head. And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean
Valjean, with all her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the
goodman a beloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M.
Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean had
continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed the secret
riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously
cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his
mind was rough and his heart was soft. During their conversations in the
Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of everything, drawing on what he had
read, and also on what he had suffered. As she listened to him, Cosettes eyes
wandered vaguely about. This simple man sufficed for Cosettes thought, the same
as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after
the butterflies, she came panting up to him and said Ah! How I have run! He
kissed her brow. Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where
Jean Valjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the
pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard,
than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little lodge furnished
with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung 1506 Les
Miserables with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean
sometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned Do go to
your own quarters! Leave me alone a little! She gave him those charming and
tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her
father. Father, I am very cold in your rooms why dont you have a carpet here
and a stove? Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who
have not even a roof over their heads. Then why is there a fire in my rooms,
and everything that is needed? Because you are a woman and a child. Bah! must
men be cold and feel uncomfortable? Certain men. That is good, I shall come
here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire. And again she said to
him Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that? Because, my daughter.
Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too. Then, in order to prevent Cosette
eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate white bread. Cosette had but a confused
recollection of her childhood. She prayed morning and evening for her mother
whom she had never known. The Thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous
figures in a dream. She remembered that she had gone one day, at night, to
fetch water in a forest. She Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1507 thought that
it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in
an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood
produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her
but millepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before
falling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjeans
daughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother
had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her. When he was
seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and dropped a silent tear,
saying to herself Perhaps this man is my mother. Cosette, although this is a
strange statement to make, in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a
convent, maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity, had ended
by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible. She did not even
know her mothers name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained
silent. If she repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once she
insisted the smile ended in a tear. This silence on the part of Jean Valjean
covered Fantine with darkness. Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear
that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?
So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talk to her
of her mother when she became a young girl, it was impossible for him to do so.
It seemed 1508 Les Miserables to him that he no longer dared. Was it because of
Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain religious horror at
letting that shadow enter Cosettes thought and of placing a third in their
destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him, the more did it seem that it
was to be feared. He thought of Fantine, and felt himself overwhelmed with
silence. Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared to
have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been in Fantine, and
which had violently quitted her during her lifetime, returned to rest upon her
after her death, to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman, and
in its shyness, to keep her in her grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously
submitting to the pressure? We who believe in death, are not among the number
who will reject this mysterious explanation. Hence the impossibility of
uttering, even for Cosette, that name of Fantine. One day Cosette said to him
Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings. My mother
must have been almost a saint during her life. Through martyrdom, replied Jean
Valjean. However, Jean Valjean was happy. When Cosette went out with him, she
leaned on his arm, proud and happy, in the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean
felt his heart melt within him with delight, at all these sparks of a
tenderness so exclusive, so wholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man
trembled, inundated with an- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1509 gelic joy he
declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told
himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a
bliss, and he thanked God, in the depths of his soul, for having permitted him
to be loved thus, he, a wretch, by that innocent being. 1510 Les Miserables
CHAPTER V THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR One day, Cosette
chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said to herself Really! It
seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This threw her in a singularly
troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she had never thought of her face.
She saw herself in her mirror, but she did not look at herself. And then, she
had so often been told that she was homely Jean Valjean alone said gently No
indeed! no indeed! At all events, Cosette had always thought herself homely,
and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And
here, all at once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said No
indeed! That night, she did not sleep. What if I were pretty! she thought. How
odd it would be if I were pretty! And she recalled those of her companions
whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent, and she said to herself
What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So? The next morning she looked at
herself again, not by accident this time, and she was assailed with doubts
Where Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1511 did I get such an idea? said she no,
I am ugly. She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes were sunken and she
was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief
that she was beautiful, but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in
it any longer. She did not look at herself again, and for more than a fortnight
she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror. In the evening,
after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework
in the drawingroom, and Jean Valjean read beside her. Once she raised her eyes
from her work, and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father
was gazing at her. On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and
it seemed to her that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said A pretty
woman! but badly dressed. Bah! she thought, he does not mean me. I am well
dressed and ugly. She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown. At
last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old Toussaint saying
Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir? Cosette did not hear her
fathers reply, but Toussaints words caused a sort of commotion within her. She
fled from the garden, ran up to her room, flew to the looking-glass,it was
three months since she had looked at herself,and gave vent to a cry. She had
just dazzled herself. She was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing
with Toussaint and her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white,
her hair was lustrous, an unac- 1512 Les Miserables customed splendor had been
lighted in her blue eyes. The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an
instant, like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also,
Toussaint had said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken,
there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again,
thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds singing, though it
was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among the trees, flowers in the
thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible delight. Jean Valjean, on his
side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart. In fact, he had,
for some time past, been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to
grow more radiant every day on Cosettes sweet face. The dawn that was smiling
for all was gloomy for him. Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long
time before she became aware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that
unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young
girls person, wounded Jean Valjeans sombre eye. He felt that it was a change in
a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of
disarranging something. This man, who had passed through all manner of
distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who had been
almost wicked and who had become almost a saint, who, after having dragged the
chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of
indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and
who could be seized at Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1513 any moment and
brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public
opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, and merely asked
of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature, of the world, one
thing, that Cosette might love him! That Cosette might continue to love him!
That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him, and from
remaining with him! Beloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested,
appeased, loaded with benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it
was well with him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him Do you want
anything better? he would have answered No. God might have said to him Do you
desire heaven? and he would have replied I should lose by it. Everything which
could affect this situation, if only on the surface, made him shudder like the
beginning of something new. He had never known very distinctly himself what the
beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively, that it was something
terrible. He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever
more triumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent
and formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of his
old age, of his misery, of his reprobation. He said to himself How beautiful
she is! What is to become of me? There, moreover, lay the difference between
his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a
mother would have gazed upon with joy. 1514 Les Miserables The first symptoms
were not long in making their appearance. On the very morrow of the day on
which she had said to herself Decidedly I am beautiful! Cosette began to pay
attention to her toilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by Pretty, but
badly dressed, the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had
vanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are
destined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is the
other. With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her.
She conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Her father
had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole science of the
bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuff which is in
fashion, the color which is becoming, that science which makes of the Parisian
woman something so charming, so deep, and so dangerous. The words heady woman
were invented for the Parisienne. In less than a month, little Cosette, in that
Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of
the best dressed women in Paris, which means a great deal more. She would have
liked to encounter her passer-by, to see what he would say, and to teach him a
lesson! The truth is, that she was ravishing in every respect, and that she
distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut
in the most marvellous way. Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He
who Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1515 felt that he could never do anything
but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings sprouting on Cosette. Moreover, from
the mere inspection of Cosettes toilet, a woman would have recognized the fact
that she had no mother. Certain little proprieties, certain special
conventionalities, were not observed by Cosette. A mother, for instance, would
have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask. The first day that
Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle, and her white crape
bonnet, she took Jean Valjeans arm, gay, radiant, rosy, proud, dazzling.
Father, she said, how do you like me in this guise? Jean Valjean replied in a
voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man Charming! He was the
same as usual during their walk. On their return home, he asked Cosette Wont
you put on that other gown and bonnet again, you know the ones I mean? This
took place in Cosettes chamber. Cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast-off
schoolgirls clothes were hanging. That disguise! said she. Father, what do you
want me to do with it? Oh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors
again. With that machine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog. Jean
Valjean heaved a deep sigh. From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette,
who had always heretofore asked to remain at home, saying Father, I enjoy
myself more here with you, now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is
the use of having a hand- 1516 Les Miserables some face and a delicious costume
if one does not display them? He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the
same taste for the back garden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not
dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean,
who was shy, never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a
dog. Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the grace
of ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is
ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who
walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of
it. But what she had lost in ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive and serious
charm. Her whole person, permeated with the joy of youth, of innocence, and of
beauty, breathed forth a splendid melancholy. It was at this epoch that Marius,
after the lapse of six months, saw her once more at the Luxembourg. Free eBooks

like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire. Destiny, with its mysterious
and fatal patience, slowly drew together these two beings, all charged and all
languishing with the stormy electricity of passion, these two souls which were
laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to
overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire. The glance
has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into
disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two beings fell in love
because they looked at each other. That is the way people do fall in love,
nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is nothing, but the rest comes
afterwards. Nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey
to each other by the exchange of that spark. At that particular hour when
Cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled Marius, Marius had no
suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette. He caused her
the same good and the same evil. 1518 Les Miserables She had been in the habit
of seeing him for a long time, and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize
and see, while looking elsewhere. Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when
she had already begun to think Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to
her, the young man was nothing to her. Still, she could not refrain from saying
to herself that he had beautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a
charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he
held himself badly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was all
his own, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole person was
noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he seemed to be poor,
yet his air was fine. On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each
other those first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps,
Cosette did not immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house
in the Rue de lOuest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had come to
spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of that strange young
man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to pay attention to her, and
it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world
agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome
and disdainful individual. A substratum of war stirred within her. It struck
her, and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take
her revenge at last. Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly con-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1519 scious, though in an indistinct fashion,
that she possessed a weapon. Women play with their beauty as children do with a
knife. They wound themselves. The reader will recall Marius hesitations, his
palpitations, his terrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This
vexed Cosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean Father, let us stroll about a
little in that direction. Seeing that Marius did not come to her, she went to
him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then, strange to say, the
first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is
boldness. This is surprising, and yet nothing is more simple. It is the two
sexes tending to approach each other and assuming, each the others qualities.
That day, Cosettes glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius glance set
Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and Cosette uneasy. From that
day forth, they adored each other. The first thing that Cosette felt was a
confused and profound melancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become
black since the day before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul
in young girls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It
melts in love, which is its sun. Cosette did not know what love was. She had
never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane
music which entered the convent, amour love was replaced by tambour drum or
pandour. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big
girls, such 1520 Les Miserables as Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, Pity is
not a pandour. But Cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied
herself much with the drum. Therefore, she did not know what name to give to
what she now felt. Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name
of ones malady? She loved with all the more passion because she loved
ignorantly. She did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful
or dangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited she loved. She
would have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her You do not sleep?
But that is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! You have
oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! You blush and turn
pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green
walk? But that is abominable! She would not have understood, and she would have
replied What fault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power and of
which I know nothing? It turned out that the love which presented itself was
exactly suited to the state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a
distance, a mute contemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the
apparition of youth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet
remaining a dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but
having as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor defect in a
word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a chimaera with a form. Any
nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at this first
stage, when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the
cloister. She had all the fears of children and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1521 all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, with which she
had been permeated for the space of five years, was still in the process of
slow evaporation from her person, and made everything tremble around her. In
this situation he was not a lover, he was not even an admirer, he was a vision.
She set herself to adoring Marius as something charming, luminous, and
impossible. As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him
with all frankness. Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk
with impatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,
and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she
said to Jean Valjean What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is! Marius and
Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did not address each other,
they did not salute each other, they did not know each other they saw each
other and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues, they
lived by gazing at each other. It was thus that Cosette gradually became a
woman and developed, beautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty,
and in ignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.
1522 Les Miserables CHAPTER VII TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF All
situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature warned Jean
Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjean shuddered to the
very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knew nothing, and yet he
scanned with obstinate attention, the darkness in which he walked, as though he
felt on one side of him something in process of construction, and on the other,
something which was crumbling away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance
with the deep law of God, by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep
out of sight of the father. Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean
sometimes espied him. Marius manners were no longer in the least natural. He
exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quite close
to them as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended to be
reading why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old coat, now he
wore his new one every day Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his
hair curled, his eyes were Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1523 very queer, he
wore gloves in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man. Cosette
allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was the matter with
her she was convinced that there was something in it, and that it must be
concealed. There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had
recently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by that
stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be accidental, no
doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident. He never opened his mouth to
Cosette about this stranger. One day, however, he could not refrain from so
doing, and, with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the
depths of its despair, he said to her What a very pedantic air that young man
has! Cosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would have replied
Why, no, he is charming. Ten years later, with the love of Marius in her heart,
she would have answered A pedant, and insufferable to the sight! You are right!
At the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained, she contented
herself with replying, with supreme calmness That young man! As though she now
beheld him for the first time in her life. How stupid I am! thought Jean
Valjean. She had not noticed him. It is I who have pointed him out to her. Oh,
simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children! It is one of the laws of
those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of those vivacious conflicts
between a first love and 1524 Les Miserables the first obstacles, that the
young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever, and that
the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared
war against Marius, which Marius, with the sublime stupidity of his passion and
his age, did not divine. Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he
changed his hour, he changed his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came
alone to the Luxembourg Marius dashed headlong into all these snares and to all
the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ingenuously
answered yes. But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her
imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following
conclusion That ninny is madly in love with Cosette, but Cosette does not even
know that he exists. None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor.
The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not
everything begin with indifference? Only once did Cosette make a mistake and
alarm him. He rose from his seat to depart, after a stay of three hours, and
she said What, already? Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the
Luxembourg, as he did not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all
things, he feared to arouse Cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to
the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius, who
perceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in all the world but an
adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing and
terrible eyes. He, who had Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1525 finally come to
believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced moments when
Marius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious
once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which had formerly contained
so much wrath, opening once more and rising up against that young man. It
almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom. What! he
was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came creeping about,
smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying Hey! Why not? He came to prowl
about his, Jean Valjeans, life! to prowl about his happiness, with the purpose
of seizing it and bearing it away! Jean Valjean added Yes, thats it! What is he
in search of? An adventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair!
And I? What! I have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most
unhappy, and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have suffered
everything that man can suffer, I have grown old without having been young, I
have lived without a family, without relatives, without friends, without life,
without children, I have left my blood on every stone, on every bramble, on
every mile-post, along every wall, I have been gentle, though others have been
hard to me, and kind, although others have been malicious, I have become an
honest man once more, in spite of everything, I have repented of the evil that
I have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the
moment when I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, at the
moment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I have what I
desire, it 1526 Les Miserables is well, it is good, I have paid, I have earned
it, all this is to take flight, all this will vanish, and I shall lose Cosette,
and I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, because it has pleased a great booby
to come and lounge at the Luxembourg. Then his eyes were filled with a sad and
extraordinary gleam. It was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an
enemy surveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief. The reader knows the
rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day he followed Cosette to the
Rue de lOuest. Another day he spoke to the porter. The porter, on his side,
spoke, and said to Jean Valjean Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is
asking for you? On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which
Marius at last perceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure.
He swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg
or in the Rue de lOuest. He returned to the Rue Plumet. Cosette did not
complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she did not seek to learn
his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being
divined, and of betraying herself. Jean Valjean had no experience of these
miseries, the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he
was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave
significance of Cosettes silence. He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and
he grew gloomy. On his side and on hers, inexperience had joined Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1527 issue. Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette Would you
like to come to the Luxembourg? A ray illuminated Cosettes pale face. Yes, said
she. They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went there.
Marius was not there. On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again
Would you like to come to the Luxembourg? She replied, sadly and gently No.
Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this gentleness.
What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so
impenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place in
Cosettes soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean remained seated
on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passed whole nights asking
himself What has Cosette in her mind? and in thinking of the things that she
might be thinking about. Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast
towards that cloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that
inaccessible glacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy,
that convent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where all
perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that Eden
forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged! How he
regretted his abnegation and his 1528 Les Miserables folly in having brought
Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurled to the
earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, What have I done?
However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper, no
harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjeans manners were more
tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could have betrayed his lack of
joy, it was his increased suavity. On her side, Cosette languished. She
suffered from the absence of Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly,
without exactly being conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on
their customary strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom
of her heart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, and
that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her father would
take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had
tacitly accepted Cosettes tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. So
Marius had disappeared all was over. The day on which she returned to the
Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? Should she ever
find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, which nothing relieved, and
which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer,
whether it was raining or shining, whether the birds were singing, whether it
was the season for dahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming
than the Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched
too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done her Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1529 marketing well or ill and she remained dejected, absorbed,
attentive to but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes
by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.
However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this, except
her pallor. She still wore her sweet face for him. This pallor sufficed but too
thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean. Sometimes he asked her What is the matter
with you? She replied There is nothing the matter with me. And after a silence,
when she divined that he was sad also, she would add And you, fatheris there
anything wrong with you? With me? Nothing, said he. These two beings who had
loved each other so exclusively, and with so touching an affection, and who had
lived so long for each other now suffered side by side, each on the others
account without acknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each
other, and with a smile. 1530 Les Miserables CHAPTER VIII THE CHAIN-GANG Jean
Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its sorrows, always
possesses its own peculiar radiance. At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly
that he became puerile. It is the property of grief to cause the childish side
of man to reappear. He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was
escaping from him. He would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her
enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we
have just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very
childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the
imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in
full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. He
envied that gilded man what happiness it would be, he said to himself, if he
could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if Cosette could
behold him thus, she would be dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and
passed the gates of the Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and
that would suffice for Cosette, and would Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1531
dispel her idea of looking at young men. An unforeseen shock was added to these
sad reflections. In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come
to dwell in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took
a pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which befits
those who are entering life and those who are quitting it. For those who love
solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night, with
the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets are deserted and the birds are
singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked to rise early. These matutinal
excursions were planned on the preceding evening. He proposed, and she agreed.
It was arranged like a plot, they set out before daybreak, and these trips were
so many small delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities please young
people. Jean Valjeans inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least
frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then existed,
in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows, which were
almost confounded with the city, where grew in summer sickly grain, and which,
in autumn, after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, not
of having been reaped, but peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields.
Cosette was not bored there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her.
There, she became a little girl once more, she could run and almost play she
took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjeans knees, and gathered bunches of
flowers. She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them
gentleness and tender- 1532 Les Miserables ness are born with love, and the
young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has
mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she
placed on her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing
until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers. Even
after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early strolls. One
morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn
of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day near the Barriere
du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment. A few
constellations here and there in the deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the
heavens all white, a quiver amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious
chill of twilight. A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling
at a prodigious height, and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness
calmed immensity. In the East, the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the
clear horizon with the sharpness of steel Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising
behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy
edifice. All was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray
laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to their work
along the side-paths. Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks
deposited at the gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the
highway, his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the
point of rising he had sunk Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1533 into one of
those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated, which
imprison even the eye, and which are equivalent to four walls. There are
meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them,
time is required to return to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these
reveries. He was thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if
nothing came between him and her, of the light with which she filled his life,
a light which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in his
revery. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the clouds as they
turned rosy. All at once Cosette exclaimed Father, I should think some one was
coming yonder. Jean Valjean raised his eyes. Cosette was right. The causeway
which leads to the ancient Barriere du Maine is a prolongation, as the reader
knows, of the Rue de Sevres, and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard.
At the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches,
they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a
sort of confused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was
coming from the boulevard was turning into the road. It grew larger, it seemed
to move in an orderly manner, though it was bristling and quivering it seemed
to be a vehicle, but its load could not be distinctly made out. There were
horses, wheels, shouts whips were cracking. By degrees the outlines became
fixed, although bathed in shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just
turned from the boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course
to- 1534 Les Miserables wards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean a second,
of the same aspect, followed, then a third, then a fourth seven chariots made
their appearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of
the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were visible
through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a clanking became
audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as this something advanced,
the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned into a terrible thing such as
emerges from the cave of dreams. As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was
outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew
white the day, which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap
which was at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned
into the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be Seven wagons were
driving in a file along the road. The first six were singularly constructed.
They resembled coopers drays they consisted of long ladders placed on two
wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities. Each dray, or rather let
us say, each ladder, was attached to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders
strange clusters of men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to
be divined rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side,
back to back, facing the passersby, their legs dangling in the air,this was the
manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backs they had
something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on their necks something
which shone, and which was Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1535 an iron collar.
Each man had his collar, but the chain was for all so that if these four and
twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with
a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground with the
chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds. In the back and
front of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets stood erect, each holding one
end of the chain under his foot. The iron necklets were square. The seventh
vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six
horses, and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers,
and chains, among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and
stretched at full length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all
lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have
served for former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road.
On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing
three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered
with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of
undertakers men, half gray, half blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with
red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short sabres, muskets, and cudgels they
were a species of soldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed of the
abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner. The one who
appeared to be their chief held a postilions whip in his hand. All these
details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more clearly outlined
as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of the 1536 Les Miserables
convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist. This procession
was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier, the last was
barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng, sprung, it is impossible to say
whence, and formed in a twinkling, as is frequently the case in Paris, pressed
forward from both sides of the road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the
shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners
hastening up to gaze were audible. The men massed upon the drays allowed
themselves to be jolted along in silence. They were livid with the chill of
morning. They all wore linen trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into
wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their
accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the
harlequin in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen
nightcaps, and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the
elbow many wore womens headgear, others had baskets on their heads hairy
breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs
could be descried temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids eruptions and
unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or three had a straw rope
attached to the crossbar of the dray, and suspended under them like a stirrup,
which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to his
mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed
to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating. There were no eyes there Free

with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the men in chains did not utter a
syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels
descended on shoulder-blades or skulls some of these men were yawning their
rags were terrible their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their
heads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously,
their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the rear
of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter. This file of
vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It was evident that to-morrow,
that an hour hence, a pouring rain might descend, that it might be followed by
another and another, and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched,
that once soaked, these men would not get dry again, that once chilled, they
would not again get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their
bones by the downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes
from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the
chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs would continue
to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human
beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, and delivered
over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies of the air, like trees and
stones. Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick
men, who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon, and
who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery. 1538 Les
Miserables Suddenly, the sun made its appearance the immense light of the
Orient burst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those
ferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins, oaths,
and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two
parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity.
Thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible
demons with their masks removed, fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up,
this wild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths
quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women the
dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows
there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of
wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the suns
brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load
which headed the line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of
their voices with a haggard joviality, a potpourri by Desaugiers, then famous,
called The Vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the cross-lanes,
countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse
strains droned by spectres. All sorts of distress met in this procession as in
chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men,
youths, bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation,
savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those
of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1539 by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton
faces, to which death alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had
been a slave, in all probability, and who could make a comparison of his
chains. The frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows
at that degree of abasement, the last transformations were suffered by all in
their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was the equal of
intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice possible between these
men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident that the
person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified
them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical
disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless,
horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a result all additions
of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaled a common soul, and each
dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side of the one where they were
singing, there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging
one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load menaced
the spectators, another blasphemed God the last was as silent as the tomb.
Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march.
The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister wise, not on
the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, what was more
mournful than that, on the gibbet cart. One of the guards, who had a hook on
the end of his cudgel, made a pretence from time to time, of stirring up this
1540 Les Miserables mass of human filth. An old woman in the crowd pointed them
out to her little boy five years old, and said to him Rascal, let that be a
warning to you! As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to
be the captain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful
dull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the seven
dray-loads many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled the delight of
the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies on these wounds. Jean
Valjeans eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were no longer eyes they
were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of
certain wretched men, which seem unconscious of reality, and in which flames
the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes. He was not looking at a
spectacle, he was seeing a vision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make his
escape he could not move his feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize
upon you and hold you fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid,
asking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this
sepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium which
was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture
habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was, in
fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this detour in order
to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau,
and that, five and thirty years before, he had himself passed through that
barrier. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1541 Cosette was no less terrified,
but in a different way. She did not understand what she beheld did not seem to
her to be possible at length she cried Father! What are those men in those
carts? Jean Valjean replied Convicts. Whither are they going? To the galleys.
At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, became zealous,
blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was a perfect storm
of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it, a hideous obedience was evoked
by the torture, and all held their peace, darting glances like chained wolves.
Cosette trembled in every limb she resumed Father, are they still men?
Sometimes, answered the unhappy man. It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had
set out before daybreak from Bicetre, and had taken the road to Mans in order
to avoid Fontainebleau, where the King then was. This caused the horrible
journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged
with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it. Jean Valjean
returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters are shocks, and the memory
that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up. Nevertheless, Jean
Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to the Rue de Babylone with
Cosette, the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what
they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own 1542 Les
Miserables dejection to notice her words and reply to them. But when Cosette
was leaving him in the evening, to betake herself to bed, he heard her say in a
low voice, and as though talking to herself It seems to me, that if I were to
find one of those men in my pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the
sight of him close at hand. Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of
that tragic day, there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,
fetes in Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical
performances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at the Arc de lEtoile,
illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and took
Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her from the
memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling tumult of all
Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her. The review with which
the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural Jean
Valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of
a man who is betaking himself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain
its object. Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,
moreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion with the light
and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter
of enjoyment called a public fete so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that
he had succeeded, and that no trace of that hideous vision remained. Some days
later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and they were both on the
steps leading to the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1543 garden, another
infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself,
and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused
Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in that negligent
attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which
produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and, with her head bathed in
light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glances of the tender
old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful
legend, I love a little, passionately, etc.who was there who could have taught
her? She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion
that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a
fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air of
that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny
fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by
that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side. White
cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one would have said that they
had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves
from her flower she seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was,
it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder
with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean Father, what are
the galleys like? 1544 Les Miserables BOOK FOURTH. SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN

WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN Thus their life clouded over by degrees. But one diversion,
which had formerly been a happiness, remained to them, which was to carry bread
to those who were hungry, and clothing to those who were cold. Cosette often
accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to the poor, on which they recovered
some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes, when the day had
been a good one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed
many little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this
epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den. On the day following
that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning,
calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on his left arm which was much
inflamed, and very angry, which resembled a burn, and which he explained in
some way or other. This wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a
month with fever. He would not call in a doctor. When Cosette urged 1546 Les
Miserables him, Call the dog-doctor, said he. Cosette dressed the wound morning
and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to
him, that Jean Valjean felt all his former joy returning, his fears and
anxieties dissipating, and he gazed at Cosette, saying Oh! what a kindly wound!
Oh! what a good misfortune! Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had
deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the
back courtyard. She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to
him the books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean
Valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these
ineffable rays the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosettes
coldness,all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had reached the
point where he said to himself I imagined all that. I am an old fool. His
happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the Thenardiers made in
the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had, after a fashion, glided over
him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was
lostwhat more did he care for! he only thought of those wretched beings to pity
them. Here they are in prison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for
doing any harm, he thought, but what a lamentable family in distress! As for
the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette had not referred to it
again. Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent Cosette
had the voice of a linnet with a soul, and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1547
sometimes, in the evening, in the wounded mans humble abode, she warbled
melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean. Spring came the garden was so
delightful at that season of the year, that Jean Valjean said to Cosette You
never go there I want you to stroll in it. As you like, father, said Cosette.
And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in the garden,
generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, who was probably
afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went there. Jean Valjeans
wound had created a diversion. When Cosette saw that her father was suffering
less, that he was convalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she
experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and
naturally had it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were
growing longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it
a portion of our sadness then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh as
dawn always is, gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times
like the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature has charming gleams
which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the meadows and the flowers into
the heart of man. Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating
influence of that April joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself.
Insensibly, and without her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from
her spirit. In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at
midday. Cosette was 1548 Les Miserables no longer sad. However, though this was
so, she did not account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten oclock,
after breakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden
for a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight
in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she did not perceive
that she laughed every moment and that she was happy. Jean Valjean,
intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more. Oh! What a good wound!
he repeated in a whisper. And he felt grateful to the Thenardiers. His wound
once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls. It is a mistake to
suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited
regions of Paris without meeting with some adventure. Free eBooks at Planet

PHENOMENON One evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered
that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome.
He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He strolled out beyond the
Salpetriere into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where
there is no one, one always finds something. He reached a settlement which
appeared to him to be the village of Austerlitz. In one of his preceding
lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old
woman, and in that garden, a passable apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a
sort of fruit-house, which was not securely fastened, and where one might
contrive to get an apple. One apple is a supper one apple is life. That which
was Adams ruin 1550 Les Miserables might prove Gavroches salvation. The garden
abutted on a solitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the
arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge. Gavroche
directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane, he recognized the
apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the hedge a hedge means
merely one stride. The day was declining, there was not even a cat in the lane,
the hour was propitious. Gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge,
then suddenly paused. Some one was talking in the garden. Gavroche peeped
through one of the breaks in the hedge. A couple of paces distant, at the foot
of the hedge on the other side, exactly at the point where the gap which he was
meditating would have been made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which
formed a bench, and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while
the old woman was standing in front of him. The old woman was grumbling.
Gavroche, who was not very discreet, listened. Monsieur Mabeuf! said the old
woman. Mabeuf! thought Gavroche, that name is a perfect farce. The old man who
was thus addressed, did not stir. The old woman repeated Monsieur Mabeuf! The
old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind to answer
What is it, Mother Plutarque? Mother Plutarque! thought Gavroche, another
farcical Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1551 name. Mother Plutarque began
again, and the old man was forced to accept the conversation The landlord is
not pleased. Why? We owe three quarters rent. In three months, we shall owe him
for four quarters. He says that he will turn you out to sleep. I will go. The
green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave her fagots. What
will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have no wood. There is the
sun. The butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat.
That is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy. What shall we
have for dinner? Bread. The baker demands a settlement, and says, no money, no
bread. That is well. What will you eat? We have apples in the apple-room. But,
Monsieur, we cant live like that without money. I have none. The old woman went
away, the old man remained alone. He fell into thought. Gavroche became
thoughtful also. It was almost dark. 1552 Les Miserables The first result of
Gavroches meditation was, that instead of scaling the hedge, he crouched down
under it. The branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket. Come,
exclaimed Gavroche mentally, heres a nook! and he curled up in it. His back was
almost in contact with Father Mabeufs bench. He could hear the octogenarian
breathe. Then, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep. It was a cat-nap, with one
eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept on the watch. The twilight pallor of
the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of
dark bushes. All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their
appearance. One was in front, the other some distance in the rear. There come
two creatures, muttered Gavroche. The first form seemed to be some elderly
bourgeois, who was bent and thoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was
walking slowly because of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.
The second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by that of the
first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness and agility were
discernible. This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it,
the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the hat was of good
shape, the coat black, well cut, probably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at
the waist. The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the
hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1553 profile had a rose in its mouth. This
second form was well known to Gavroche it was Montparnasse. He could have told
nothing about the other, except that he was a respectable old man. Gavroche
immediately began to take observations. One of these two pedestrians evidently
had a project connected with the other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the
course of events. The bedroom had turned into a hidingplace at a very opportune
moment. Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened
something threatening. Gavroche felt his gamins heart moved with compassion for
the old man. What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of
another! It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse. Gavroche did
not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and the
child in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian
eighteen years of age. While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place,
abruptly and hideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of
the spider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded upon
the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him, and Gavroche
with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of these men was
underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee of marble upon his
breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had expected. The one who lay on
the earth was Montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man. All this
took place a few paces distant from 1554 Les Miserables Gavroche. The old man had
received the shock, had returned it, and that in such a terrible fashion, that
in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles. Heres a
hearty veteran! thought Gavroche. He could not refrain from clapping his hands.
But it was applause wasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and
deafened as they were, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the
struggle. Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged
in this aside Can he be dead! The goodman had not uttered a word, nor given
vent to a cry. He rose to his feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse
Get up. Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasses
attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught
by a sheep. Gavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his
eyes with his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely. He was repaid for his
conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator. He was able to catch on
the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic
accent. The goodman questioned, Montparnasse replied. How old are you?
Nineteen. You are strong and healthy. Why do you not work? Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1555 It bores me. What is your trade? An idler. Speak
seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like to be? A thief. A
pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He stood
motionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse. Every moment the
vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast
caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried a crook of the knee, twisted his limbs
desperately, and made efforts to escape. The old man did not appear to notice
it, and held both his arms with one hand, with the sovereign indifference of
absolute force. The old mans revery lasted for some time, then, looking
steadily at Montparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst
of the darkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did not
lose a single syllable My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of
the most laborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare
to toil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is the
rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty and ferocious
if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will be drawn in bodily. That
machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time, and save yourself!
Otherwise, it is all over with you in a short 1556 Les Miserables time you will
be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more. Toil, lazybones!
there is no more repose for you! The iron hand of implacable toil has seized
you. You do not wish to earn your living, to have a task, to fulfil a duty! It
bores you to be like other men? Well! You will be different. Labor is the law
he who rejects it will find ennui his torment. You do not wish to be a
workingman, you will be a slave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp
you again on the other. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its
negro slave. Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you shall
have the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle in your
throat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work it will seem to
you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester, the sailor, the
blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise.
What radiance surrounds the forge! To guide the plough, to bind the sheaves, is
joy. The bark at liberty in the wind, what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve,
drag on, roll, march! Drag your halter. You are a beast of burden in the team
of hell! Ah! To do nothing is your object. Well, not a week, not a day, not an hour
shall you have free from oppression. You will be able to lift nothing without
anguish. Every minute that passes will make your muscles crack. What is a
feather to others will be a rock to you. The simplest things will become steep
acclivities. Life will become monstrous all about you. To go, to come, to
breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. Your lungs will produce on you
the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether you shall walk here rather
than there, will Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1557 become a problem that
must be solved. Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push, and
there he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will be obliged to
pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step into the street do? He
goes down stairs you will tear up your sheets, little by little you will make
of them a rope, then you will climb out of your window, and you will suspend
yourself by that thread over an abyss, and it will be night, amid storm, rain,
and the hurricane, and if the rope is too short, but one way of descending will
remain to you, to fall. To drop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown
height, on what? On what is beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a
chimney-flue, at the risk of burning or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at
the risk of drowning I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to
mask, of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a
day, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A lock
presents itself the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith. If
you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art
you will take a large sou, you will cut it in two plates with what tools? You
will have to invent them. That is your business. Then you will hollow out the
interior of these plates, taking great care of the outside, and you will make
on the edges a thread, so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a
box and its cover. The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be
suspected. To the overseers it will be only a sou to you it will be a box. What
will you put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you
will 1558 Les Miserables have cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this
saw, as long as a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the
lock, you will sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your
window, and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this prodigy
accomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patience executed,
what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author? The
dungeon. There is your future. What precipices are idleness and pleasure! Do
you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution? To live in idleness on
the property of society! to be useless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads
straight to the depth of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a
parasite! He will become vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You
have but one thought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drink
water, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose
cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted to your limbs.
You will break those fetters, you will flee. That is well. You will crawl on
your belly through the brushwood, and you will eat grass like the beasts of the
forest. And you will be recaptured. And then you will pass years in a dungeon,
riveted to a wall, groping for your jug that you may drink, gnawing at a
horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch, eating beans that the
worms have eaten before you. You will be a wood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have
pity on yourself, you miserable young child, who were sucking at nurse less
than twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a mother still alive! I conjure
you, listen to me, I entreat you. You desire Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

of twenty. And you will come out at fifty! You will enter young, rosy, fresh,
with brilliant eyes, and all your white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair
you will come out broken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white
locks! Ah! my poor child, you are on the wrong road idleness is counselling you
badly the hardest of all work is thieving. Believe me, do not undertake that
painful profession of an idle man. It is not comfortable to become a rascal. It
is less disagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder on what I have
said to you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is. And the
old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latters hand Montparnasse
weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it to slide gently into the
back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanical precaution as though he had
stolen it. All this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back and
tranquilly resumed his stroll. The blockhead! muttered Montparnasse. Who was
this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined. Montparnasse watched
him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk. This contemplation was fatal
to him. 1560 Les Miserables While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew
near. Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeuf
was still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gamin emerged
from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the dark, as the
latter stood there motionless. In this manner he came up to Montparnasse
without being seen or heard, gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of
that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the purse, withdrew his hand, and
having recourse once more to his crawling, he slipped away like an adder
through the shadows. Montparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard, and
who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life, perceived nothing.
When Gavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he
flung the purse over the hedge, and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.
The purse fell on Father Mabeufs foot. This commotion roused him. He bent over
and picked up the purse. He did not understand in the least, and opened it. The
purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the
other lay six napoleons. M. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his
housekeeper. That has fallen from heaven, said Mother Plutarque. Free eBooks at

BEGINNING 1562 Les Miserables CHAPTER I SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED
Cosettes grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or five months
previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, entered upon its
convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her father, the gayety of the
birds and flowers, caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter
gradually, drop by drop, into that soul, which was so virgin and so young. Was
the fire wholly extinct there? Or was it merely that layers of ashes had
formed? The truth is, that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any
longer. One day she suddenly thought of Marius Why! said she, I no longer think
of him. That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, with a
wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a sword under
his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing the gate. Moreover, he
had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face, was vain, insolent and
good-looking quite the reverse of Marius. He Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1563 had a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this officer doubtless
belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone. On the following
day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the hour. From that time forth,
was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day. The officers comrades
perceived that there was, in that badly kept garden, behind that malicious
rococo fence, a very pretty creature, who was almost always there when the
handsome lieutenant,who is not unknown to the reader, and whose name was
Theodule Gillenormand, passed by. See here! they said to him, theres a little
creature there who is making eyes at you, look. Have I the time, replied the
lancer, to look at all the girls who look at me? This was at the precise moment
when Marius was descending heavily towards agony, and was saying If I could but
see her before I die! Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that
moment gazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and
he would have expired with grief. Whose fault was it? No ones. Marius possessed
one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide
Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it
again. Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatal
phase of feminine revery abandoned to it- 1564 Les Miserables self, in which
the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which
cling, as chance directs, to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a
wine-shop A rapid and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, be she rich
or poor, for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances are made in very
high circles, real misalliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young
man, without name, without birth, without fortune, is a marble column which
bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas, so such and such a man
of the world satisfied and opulent, who has polished boots and varnished words,
if looked at not outside, but inside, a thing which is reserved for his wife,
is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous
passions the post of a drinking-shop. What did Cosettes soul contain? Passion
calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain
depth, and gloomy lower down. The image of the handsome officer was reflected
in the surface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths? Quite at the
bottom?Possibly. Cosette did not know. A singular incident supervened. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1565 CHAPTER II COSETTES APPREHENSIONS During the
first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This, as the reader
knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals. He remained absent a
day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No one knew, not even Cosette.
Once only, on the occasion of one of these departures, she had accompanied him
in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she
read Impasse de la Planchette. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette
back to the Rue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking in the house
that Jean Valjean took these little trips. So Jean Valjean was absent. He had
said I shall return in three days. That evening, Cosette was alone in the
drawing-room. In order to get rid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ,
and had begun to sing, accompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe
Hunters astray in the wood! which is probably the most beautiful thing in all
1566 Les Miserables the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained
wrapped in thought. All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of
footsteps in the garden. It could not be her father, he was absent it could not
be Toussaint, she was in bed, and it was ten oclock at night. She stepped to
the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and laid her ear against it.
It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walking very
softly. She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a
small wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was at the
full. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day. There was no one there.
She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that was visible
was that the street was deserted as usual. Cosette thought that she had been
mistaken. She thought that she had heard a noise. It was a hallucination produced
by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the
mind terrified depths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and
in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of
the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight. She thought no
more about it. Moreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in
her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1567 the adventuress who runs barefoot. It will be remembered that she was more
of a lark than a dove. There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her.
On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was strolling
in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her, she
fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding
evening, as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk, and not
very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step
on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to
side, and she paid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing. She emerged
from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps. The
moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosettes shadow in front of her
upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery. Cosette halted in alarm.
Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow,
which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow which had a round hat.
It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border of the
clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette. She stood for a moment
without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or stir, or turn her head. Then
she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely. 1568 Les
Miserables There was no one there. She glanced on the ground. The figure had
disappeared. She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as
far as the gate, and found nothing. She felt herself absolutely chilled with
terror. Was this another hallucination? What! Two days in succession! One
hallucination might pass, but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about
it was, that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear
round hats. On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what
she thought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to see her
father shrug his shoulders and say to her You are a little goose. Jean Valjean
grew anxious. It cannot be anything, said he. He left her under some pretext,
and went into the garden, and she saw him examining the gate with great
attention. During the night she woke up this time she was sure, and she
distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her
window. She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, there was
a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. Just as she was about to
scream, the moon lighted up the mans profile. It was her father. She returned
to her bed, saying to herself He is very uneasy! Jean Valjean passed that night
and the two succeeding nights in the garden. Cosette saw him through the hole
in her shutter. On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1569 begun to rise later at one oclock in the
morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst of laughter and her fathers voice
calling her Cosette! She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and
opened her window. Her father was standing on the grass-plot below. I have
waked you for the purpose of reassuring you, said he look, there is your shadow
with the round hat. And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the
moon, and which did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a
man wearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of sheet
iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof. Cosette joined in his
laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed, and the next morning,
as she was at breakfast with her father, she made merry over the sinister
garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney-pots. Jean Valjean became quite
tranquil once more as for Cosette, she did not pay much attention to the
question whether the chimney-pot was really in the direction of the shadow
which she had seen, or thought she had seen, and whether the moon had been in
the same spot in the sky. She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of
a chimney-pot which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires
when some one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when
Cosette had turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this.
Cosettes serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to 1570 Les Miserables
her to be complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there could
possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night. A few
days later, however, a fresh incident occurred. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1571 CHAPTER III ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT In the garden, near
the railing on the street, there was a stone bench, screened from the eyes of
the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, but which could, in case of
necessity, be reached by an arm from the outside, past the trees and the gate.
One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out Cosette
had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze was blowing briskly
in the trees, Cosette was meditating an objectless sadness was taking
possession of her little by little, that invincible sadness evoked by the
evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb
which is ajar at that hour. Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow. Cosette
rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the grass drenched in dew,
and saying to herself, through 1572 Les Miserables the species of melancholy
somnambulism in which she was plunged Really, one needs wooden shoes for the
garden at this hour. One takes cold. She returned to the bench. As she was
about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot which she had quitted,
a tolerably large stone which had, evidently, not been there a moment before.
Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once the idea
occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself, that
some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrust through the railing,
and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, the fear was genuine the stone
was there. No doubt was possible she did not touch it, fled without glancing
behind her, took refuge in the house, and immediately closed with shutter,
bolt, and bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps. She inquired
of Toussaint Has my father returned yet? Not yet, Mademoiselle. We have already
noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered. May we be permitted to
dispense with it for the future. The musical notation of an infirmity is
repugnant to us. Jean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal
strolls, often returned quite late at night. Toussaint, went on Cosette, are
you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden, at
least with bars, in the evening, and to put the little iron things in the
little rings that close them? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1573 Oh! be easy
on that score, Miss. Toussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well
aware of the fact, but she could not refrain from adding It is so solitary
here. So far as that is concerned, said Toussaint, it is true. We might be
assassinated before we had time to say ouf! And Monsieur does not sleep in the
house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters up like prisons.
Lone women! That is enough to make one shudder, I believe you! Just imagine,
what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say Hold your
tongue! and begin to cut your throat. Its not the dying so much you die, for
one must die, and thats all right its the abomination of feeling those people
touch you. And then, their knives they cant be able to cut well with them! Ah,
good gracious! Be quiet, said Cosette. Fasten everything thoroughly. Cosette,
terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, and possibly, also, by the
recollection of the apparitions of the past week, which recurred to her memory,
dared not even say to her Go and look at the stone which has been placed on the
bench! for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter. She
saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go
all over the house from garret to cellar, locked herself up in her own chamber,
bolted her door, looked under her couch, went to bed and slept badly. All night
long she saw that big stone, as large as a mountain and full of caverns. At
sunrise,the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors
of the past night, and our laugh- 1574 Les Miserables ter is in direct
proportion to our terror which they have caused,at sunrise Cosette, when she
woke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself What have I been
thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a week or two ago
in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of the chimney-pot! Am I becoming
a coward? The sun, which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters, and
turning the damask curtains crimson, reassured her to such an extent that
everything vanished from her thoughts, even the stone. There was no more a
stone on the bench than there was a man in a round hat in the garden I dreamed
about the stone, as I did all the rest. She dressed herself, descended to the
garden, ran to the bench, and broke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was
there. But this lasted only for a moment. That which is terror by night is
curiosity by day. Bah! said she, come, let us see what it is. She lifted the
stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was something which resembled a
letter. It was a white envelope. Cosette seized it. There was no address on one
side, no seal on the other. Yet the envelope, though unsealed, was not empty.
Papers could be seen inside. Cosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it
was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety. Cosette drew from the
envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper, each page of which was
numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting, as
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1575 Cosette thought. Cosette looked for a name
there was none. To whom was this addressed? To her, probably, since a hand had
deposited the packet on her bench. From whom did it come? An irresistible
fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the
leaflets which were trembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street,
the acacias all bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring
roof, and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to
herself that she must know what it contained. This is what she read. 1576 Les
Miserables CHAPTER IV A HEART BENEATH A STONE The reduction of the universe to
a single being, the expansion of a single being even to God, that is love. Love
is the salutation of the angels to the stars. How sad is the soul, when it is
sad through love! What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone
fills the world! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One
could comprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of
all evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love. The glimpse of
a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to
cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams. God is behind everything,
but everything hides God. Things are black, creatures are opaque. To love a
being is to render that being transparent. Certain thoughts are prayers. There
are moments when, whatever the attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its
knees. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1577 Parted lovers beguile absence by a
thousand chimerical devices, which possess, however, a reality of their own.
They are prevented from seeing each other, they cannot write to each other they
discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond. They send each other
the song of the birds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the
light of the sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation.
And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is sufficiently
potent to charge all nature with its messages. Oh Spring! Thou art a letter
that I write to her. The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to
minds. Love, that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the
infinite, the inexhaustible is requisite. Love participates of the soul itself.
It is of the same nature. Like it, it is the divine spark like it, it is
incorruptible, indivisible, imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists
within us, which is immortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which
nothing can extinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our
bones, and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven. Oh Love! Adorations!
voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other, of two hearts which
exchange with each other, of two glances which penetrate each other! You will
come to me, will you not, bliss! strolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and
radiant days! I have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached
themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the
destinies of men. 1578 Les Miserables God can add nothing to the happiness of
those who love, except to give them endless duration. After a life of love, an
eternity of love is, in fact, an augmentation but to increase in intensity even
the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is
impossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude
of man. You look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and because
it is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater
mystery, woman. All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We
lack air and we stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible.
Suffocation of the soul. When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred
and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are
concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same
destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love,
soar. On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she
walks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do to think of
her so intently that she is constrained to think of you. What love commences
can be finished by God alone. True love is in despair and is enchanted over a
glove lost or a handkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion
and its hopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely
little. If you are a stone, be adamant if you are a plant, be the sensitive
plant if you are a man, be love. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1579 Nothing
suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise we possess paradise,
we desire heaven. Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love.
Understand how to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and
more than heaven, it has voluptuousness. Does she still come to the Luxembourg?
No, sir. This is the church where she attends mass, is it not? She no longer
comes here. Does she still live in this house? She has moved away. Where has she
gone to dwell? She did not say. What a melancholy thing not to know the address
of ones soul! Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses.
Shame on the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a child
of him! There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There
is a being who carried off my sky when she went away. Oh! would that we were
lying side by side in the same grave, hand in hand, and from time to time, in
the darkness, gently caressing a finger,that would suffice for my eternity! Ye
who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to live in it.
Love. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture. There
is ecstasy in agony. Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that
they sing. 1580 Les Miserables Love is a celestial respiration of the air of
paradise. Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it it is a long
trial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This destiny,
the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb. Then
something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the definitive. The
definitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceive the infinite the
definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead. In the meanwhile, love
and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! to him who shall have loved only
bodies, forms, appearances! Death will deprive him of all. Try to love souls,
you will find them again. I encountered in the street, a very poor young man
who was in love. His hat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes
water trickled through his shoes, and the stars through his soul. What a grand
thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is to love! The heart
becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longer composed of anything but
what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great. An
unworthy thought can no more germinate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. The
serene and lofty soul, inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating
the clouds and the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds,
its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels
anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests of
mountains feel the shocks of earthquake. If there did not exist some one who
loved, the sun would become extinct. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1581
CHAPTER V COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER As Cosette read, she gradually fell into
thought. At the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the
note-book, the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate, it
was his hour Cosette thought him hideous. She resumed her contemplation of the
book. It was written in the most charming of chirography, thought Cosette in
the same hand, but with divers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as
when ink has been added to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It
was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly,
without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never
read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she already perceived more
light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each
one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart
with a strange radiance. The education which she had received had always talked
to her 1582 Les Miserables of the soul, and never of love, very much as one
might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen
pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life,
eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly
flung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a
passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow,
and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. What was
this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address, without
date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of
truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin,
an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantom to
a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed ready to take
refuge in death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate,
the key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in the grave and one
finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were
what might be called drops of soul. Now, from whom could these pages come? Who
could have penned them? Cosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only. He!
Day had dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared. She felt an
unheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written! he was
there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing! While she was
forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she forgot- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1583 ten him? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for a
single moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire had been
smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly now it had
but made headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, and had inflamed her whole
being. This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul
into hers. She felt the conflagration starting up once more. She imbued herself
thoroughly with every word of the manuscript Oh yes! said she, how perfectly I
recognize all that! That is what I had already read in his eyes. As she was
finishing it for the third time, Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more,
and rattled his spurs upon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes.
She thought him insipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing,
impertinent, and extremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at
her. She turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly have thrown
something at his head. She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in
her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to
dream. When she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her
bosom. All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. The
abyss of Eden had yawned once more. All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of
bewilderment. She scarcely thought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled
skein in her brain, she could not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped
through a tremor, what? vague things. She 1584 Les Miserables dared make
herself no promises, and she did not wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes
of pallor passed over her countenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It
seemed to her, at intervals, that she was entering the land of chimaeras she
said to herself Is this reality? Then she felt of the dear paper within her
bosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles against
her flesh and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he would have
shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy, which overflowed
from beneath her eyelids.Oh yes! she thought, it is certainly he! This comes
from him, and is for me! And she told herself that an intervention of the
angels, a celestial chance, had given him back to her. Oh transfiguration of
love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, that intervention of the angels, was a
pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief, from the Charlemagne
Courtyard to the Lions Ditch, over the roofs of La Force. Free eBooks at Planet

evening came, Jean Valjean went out Cosette dressed herself. She arranged her
hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dress whose bodice had
received one snip of the scissors too much, and which, through this slope,
permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, and was, as young girls say, a
trifle indecent. It was not in the least indecent, but it was prettier than
usual. She made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so. Did she mean to
go out? No. Was she expecting a visitor? No. At dusk, she went down to the
garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen, which opened on the back yard. She
began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branches from time
to time with her hand, because there were some which hung very low. In this
manner she reached the bench. The stone was still there. She sat down, and
gently laid her white hand on this stone 1586 Les Miserables as though she
wished to caress and thank it. All at once, she experienced that indefinable
impression which one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even
when she does not see the person. She turned her head and rose to her feet. It
was he. His head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His black
clothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on his fine
brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of incomparable
sweetness, he had something about him that suggested death and night. His face
was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and by the thought of a soul
that is taking flight. He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a
man. He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant. Cosette,
though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly, for she felt
herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of something ineffable and
melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in his eyes which she could
not see. Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Had
it not been for this tree, she would have fallen. Then she heard his voice,
that voice which she had really never heard, barely rising above the rustle of
the leaves, and murmuring Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not
live Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1587 on as I was living, and I have come.
Have you read what I placed there on the bench? Do you recognize me at all?
Have no fear of me. It is a long time, you remember the day, since you looked
at me at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator. And the day when you passed before
me? It was on the 16th of June and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I
have not seen you for a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs,
and she told me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de lOuest, on
the third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,you see that I know! I
followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then you disappeared. I
thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the newspapers under the
arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you. But no. It was a person who had a bonnet
like yours. At night I came hither. Do not be afraid, no one sees me. I come to
gaze upon your windows near at hand. I walk very softly, so that you may not
hear, for you might be alarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned
round, I fled. Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did it affect you
because I heard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt you. No,
it is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come sometimes I think that I
am going to die. If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I speak to you, but
I do not know what I am saying I may have displeased you have I displeased you?
Oh! my mother! said she. And she sank down as though on the point of death. He
grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close, without
knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he was tottering himself.
It was as though 1588 Les Miserables his brain were full of smoke lightnings
darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him that he was
accomplishing some religious act, and that he was committing a profanation.
Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he
felt against his breast. He was beside himself with love. She took his hand and
laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, he stammered You love me, then?
She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely
audible breath Hush! Thou knowest it! And she hid her blushing face on the
breast of the superb and intoxicated young man. He fell upon the bench, and she
beside him. They had no words more. The stars were beginning to gleam. How did
it come to pass that their lips met? How comes it to pass that the birds sing,
that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows
white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills? A kiss, and
that was all. Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.
They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp earth, nor
the wet grass they looked at each other, and their hearts were full of
thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously. She did not ask him, she did
not even wonder, how he had entered there, and how he had made his way into the
garden. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1589 It seemed so simple to her that he
should be there! From time to time, Marius knee touched Cosettes knee, and both
shivered. At intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her
lips like a drop of dew on a flower. Little by little they began to talk to
each other. Effusion followed silence, which is fulness. The night was serene
and splendid overhead. These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other
everything, their dreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their
chimaeras, their weaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they
had longed for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each
other. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing could
augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They related to each
other, with candid faith in their illusions, all that love, youth, and the
remains of childhood which still lingered about them, suggested to their minds.
Their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise, that at
the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young man who had the young
girls soul, and the young girl who had the young mans soul. Each became
permeated with the other, they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled
each other. When they had finished, when they had told each other everything,
she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him What is your name? My name is
Marius, said he. And yours? My name is Cosette. 1590 Les Miserables BOOK
SIXTH.LITTLE GAVROCHE Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1591 CHAPTER I THE
MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND Since 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil
was on the way to shipwreck and was being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss
of a bankruptcy, but in the cesspool of petty debts, the Thenardier pair had
had two other children both males. That made five two girls and three boys.
Madame Thenardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still young and
very small, with remarkable luck. Got rid of is the word. There was but a mere
fragment of nature in that woman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is
more than one example extant. Like the Marechale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the
Thenardier was a mother to her daughters only. There her maternity ended. Her
hatred of the human race began with her own sons. In the direction of her sons
her evil disposition was uncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious wall in
that quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested the eldest she cursed the
other 1592 Les Miserables two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, the
most unanswerable of retortsBecause. I have no need of a litter of squalling
brats, said this mother. Let us explain how the Thenardiers had succeeded in
getting rid of their last two children and even in drawing profit from the
operation. The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was
the same one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two
children which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at the corner
of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the opportunity of
changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will remember the great
epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the Seine in Paris
thirty-five years ago, and of which science took advantage to make experiments
on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum, so beneficially
replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine. During this
epidemic, the Magnon lost both her boys, who were still very young, one in the
morning, the other in the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These
children were precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month.
These eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by
collector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du
Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon sought
an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which she formed a part,
everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lend mutual aid. Magnon
needed two children the Thenardiers had Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1593
two. The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good
investment for the other. The little Thenardiers became little Magnons. Magnon
quitted the Quai des Celestins and went to live in the Rue Clocheperce. In
Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one
street and another. The registry office being in no way warned, raised no
objections, and the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the
world. Only, the Thenardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs a
month, which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay. It is
unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to perform his compact. He
came to see the children every six months. He did not perceive the change.
Monsieur, Magnon said to him, how much they resemble you! Thenardier, to whom
avatars were easy, seized this occasion to become Jondrette. His two daughters
and Gavroche had hardly had time to discover that they had two little brothers.
When a certain degree of misery is reached, one is overpowered with a sort of
spectral indifference, and one regards human beings as though they were
spectres. Your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy
forms, barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily
confounded again with the invisible. On the evening of the day when she had
handed over her two little ones to Magnon, with express intention of renouncing
them forever, the Thenardier had felt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She
said to her husband But this is abandoning our children! Thenardier, masterful
1594 Les Miserables and phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying
Jean Jacques Rousseau did even better! From scruples, the mother proceeded to
uneasiness But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, Monsieur
Thenardier, is what we have done permissible? Thenardier replied Everything is
permissible. No one will see anything but true blue in it. Besides, no one has
any interest in looking closely after children who have not a sou. Magnon was a
sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was careful about her
toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished in an affected and
wretched style, with a clever gallicized English thief. This English woman, who
had become a naturalized Parisienne, recommended by very wealthy relations,
intimately connected with the medals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mars
diamonds, became celebrated later on in judicial accounts. She was called
Mamselle Miss. The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason
to complain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were well
cared for, as is everything from which profit is derived they were neither
badly clothed, nor badly fed they were treated almost like little
gentlemen,better by their false mother than by their real one. Magnon played
the lady, and talked no thieves slang in their presence. Thus passed several
years. Thenardier augured well from the fact. One day, he chanced to say to
Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs The father must give
them some education. All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1595 time been protected tolerably well, even
by their evil fate, were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for
themselves. A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette
garret, necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent
incarcerations, is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult
counter-society which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure
of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world. The
Thenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon. One day, a short
time after Magnon had handed to Eponine the note relating to the Rue Plumet, a
sudden raid was made by the police in the Rue Clocheperce Magnon was seized, as
was also Mamselle Miss and all the inhabitants of the house, which was of a
suspicious character, were gathered into the net. While this was going on, the
two little boys were playing in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid.
When they tried to enter the house again, they found the door fastened and the
house empty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them a
paper which their mother had left for them. On this paper there was an address
M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No. 8. The proprietor of
the stall said to them You cannot live here any longer. Go there. It is near
by. The first street on the left. Ask your way from this paper. The children
set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his hand the paper which
was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed little fingers could not close
1596 Les Miserables very firmly, and they did not keep a very good hold on the
paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of wind tore it from him,
and as night was falling, the child was not able to find it again. They began
to wander aimlessly through the streets. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1597
CHAPTER II IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE GREAT
Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do not
precisely chill but freeze one these north winds which sadden the most
beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which
enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window. It
seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar, and as though the
wind were pouring through it. In the spring of 1832, the epoch when the first
great epidemic of this century broke out in Europe, these north gales were more
harsh and piercing than ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of
winter which was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one
felt the breath of the cholera. From a meteorological point of view, these cold
winds 1598 Les Miserables possessed this peculiarity, that they did not
preclude a strong electric tension. Frequent storms, accompanied by thunder and
lightning, burst forth at this epoch. One evening, when these gales were
blowing rudely, to such a degree that January seemed to have returned and that
the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always
shivering gayly under his rags, was standing as though in ecstasy before a
wig-makers shop in the vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with
a womans woollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had
converted into a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in
intent admiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with
orangeflowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her smile to
passers-by, between two argand lamps but in reality, he was taking an
observation of the shop, in order to discover whether he could not prig from
the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then proceed to sell for a sou to
a hair-dresser in the suburbs. He had often managed to breakfast off of such a
roll. He called his species of work, for which he possessed special aptitude,
shaving barbers. While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he
muttered between his teeth Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Perhaps
it was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday. No one has ever discovered to what this
monologue referred. Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the
last occasion on which he had dined, three days Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1599 before, for it was now Friday. The barber in his shop, which was warmed by
a good stove, was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at
the enemy, that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in
his pockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed. While Gavroche was
scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsor soap, two children of
unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and still smaller than himself, one
apparently about seven years of age, the other five, timidly turned the handle
and entered the shop, with a request for something or other, alms possibly, in
a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer. They both
spoke at once, and their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice
of the younger, and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The
barber wheeled round with a furious look, and without abandoning his razor,
thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee, and
slammed his door, saying The idea of coming in and freezing everybody for
nothing! The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a
cloud had risen it had begun to rain. Little Gavroche ran after them and
accosted them Whats the matter with you, brats? We dont know where we are to
sleep, replied the elder. Is that all? said Gavroche. A great matter, truly.
The idea of bawling about that. They must be greenies! And adopting, in
addition to his superiority, which was rather bantering, an accent of tender
authority and gentle 1600 Les Miserables patronage Come along with me, young
uns! Yes, sir, said the elder. And the two children followed him as they would
have followed an archbishop. They had stopped crying. Gavroche led them up the
Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the Bastille. As Gavroche walked along,
he cast an indignant backward glance at the barbers shop. That fellow has no
heart, the whiting,35 he muttered. Hes an Englishman. 35 Merlan a sobriquet
given to hairdressers because they are white with powder. A woman who caught
sight of these three marching in a file, with Gavroche at their head, burst
into noisy laughter. This laugh was wanting in respect towards the group. Good
day, Mamselle Omnibus, said Gavroche to her. An instant later, the wig-maker
occurred to his mind once more, and he added I am making a mistake in the beast
hes not a whiting, hes a serpent. Barber, Ill go and fetch a locksmith, and Ill
have a bell hung to your tail. This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As
he strode over a gutter, he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to
meet Faust on the Brocken, and who had a broom in her hand. Madam, said he, so
you are going out with your horse? And thereupon, he spattered the polished
boots of a pe- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1601 destrian. You scamp!
shouted the furious pedestrian. Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl. Is
Monsieur complaining? Of you! ejaculated the man. The office is closed, said
Gavroche, I do not receive any more complaints. In the meanwhile, as he went on
up the street, he perceived a beggar-girl, thirteen or fourteen years old, and
clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled
under a porte-cochere. The little girl was getting to be too old for such a
thing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at the moment
when nudity becomes indecent. Poor girl! said Gavroche. She hasnt even
trousers. Hold on, take this. And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which
he had around his neck, he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the
beggar-girl, where the scarf became a shawl once more. The child stared at him
in astonishment, and received the shawl in silence. When a certain stage of
distress has been reached in his misery, the poor man no longer groans over
evil, no longer returns thanks for good. That done Brrr! said Gavroche, who was
shivering more than Saint Martin, for the latter retained one-half of his
cloak. At this brrr! the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became
furious. The wicked skies punish good deeds. 1602 Les Miserables Ah, come now!
exclaimed Gavroche, whats the meaning of this? Its re-raining! Good Heavens, if
it goes on like this, I shall stop my subscription. And he set out on the march
once more. Its all right, he resumed, casting a glance at the beggargirl, as
she coiled up under the shawl, shes got a famous peel. And looking up at the clouds
he exclaimed Caught! The two children followed close on his heels. As they were
passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate a bakers shop, for
bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turned round Ah, by the way,
brats, have we dined? Monsieur, replied the elder, we have had nothing to eat
since this morning. So you have neither father nor mother? resumed Gavroche
majestically. Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we dont know
where they are. Sometimes thats better than knowing where they are, said
Gavroche, who was a thinker. We have been wandering about these two hours,
continued the elder, we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets,
but we have found nothing. I know, ejaculated Gavroche, its the dogs who eat everything.
He went on, after a pause Ah! we have lost our authors. We dont know what we
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1603 have done with them. This should not be,
gamins. Its stupid to let old people stray off like that. Come now! we must
have a snooze all the same. However, he asked them no questions. What was more
simple than that they should have no dwelling place! The elder of the two
children, who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of
childhood, uttered this exclamation Its queer, all the same. Mamma told us that
she would take us to get a blessed spray on Palm Sunday. Bosh, said Gavroche.
Mamma, resumed the elder, is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss. Tanflute!
retorted Gavroche. Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had
been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained. At
last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied, but which
was triumphant, in reality. Let us be calm, young uns. Heres supper for three.
And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou. Without allowing the two
urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of them before him into the bakers
shop, and flung his sou on the counter, crying Boy! five centimes worth of
bread. The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a knife.
In three pieces, my boy! went on Gavroche. And he added with dignity 1604 Les
Miserables There are three of us. And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing
the three customers, had taken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up
his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the
great Fredericks snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant
apostrophe full in the bakers face Keksekca? Those of our readers who might be
tempted to espy in this interpellation of Gavroches to the baker a Russian or a
Polish word, or one of those savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos
hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are
warned that it is a word which they our readers utter every day, and which
takes the place of the phrase Quest-ce que cest que cela? The baker understood
perfectly, and replied Well! Its bread, and very good bread of the second
quality. You mean larton brutal black bread! retorted Gavroche, calmly and
coldly disdainful. White bread, boy! white bread larton savonne! Im standing
treat. The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he
surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche. Come, now, bakers boy!
said he, what are you taking our measure like that for? All three of them
placed end to end would have hardly made a measure. When the bread was cut, the
baker threw the sou into his Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1605 drawer, and
Gavroche said to the two children Grub away. The little boys stared at him in
surprise. Gavroche began to laugh. Ah! hullo, thats so! they dont understand
yet, theyre too small. And he repeated Eat away. At the same time, he held out
a piece of bread to each of them. And thinking that the elder, who seemed to
him the more worthy of his conversation, deserved some special encouragement
and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added,
as be handed him the largest share Ram that into your muzzle. One piece was
smaller than the others he kept this for himself. The poor children, including
Gavroche, were famished. As they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls, they
blocked up the shop of the baker, who, now that they had paid their money,
looked angrily at them. Lets go into the street again, said Gavroche. They set
off once more in the direction of the Bastille. From time to time, as they
passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallest halted to look at the time on a
leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord. Well, he is a very
green un, said Gavroche. Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his
1606 Les Miserables teeth All the same, if I had charge of the babes Id lock em
up better than that. Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had
reached the angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the
low and threatening wicket of La Force was visible Hullo, is that you,
Gavroche? said some one. Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse? said Gavroche. A man
had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other than Montparnasse
in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable to Gavroche. The bow-wows!
went on Gavroche, youve got a hide the color of a linseed plaster, and blue
specs like a doctor. Youre putting on style, pon my word! Hush! ejaculated
Montparnasse, not so loud. And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the
lighted shops. The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by
the hand. When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere, sheltered
from the rain and from all eyes Do you know where Im going? demanded
Montparnasse. To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,36 replied Gavroche. 36 The
scaffold. Joker! And Montparnasse went on Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1607 Im
going to find Babet. Ah! exclaimed Gavroche, so her name is Babet. Montparnasse
lowered his voice Not she, he. Ah! Babet. Yes, Babet. I thought he was buckled.
He has undone the buckle, replied Montparnasse. And he rapidly related to the
gamin how, on the morning of that very day, Babet, having been transferred to
La Conciergerie, had made his escape, by turning to the left instead of to the
right in the police office. Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill.
What a dentist! he cried. Montparnasse added a few details as to Babets flight,
and ended with Oh! Thats not all. Gavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane
that Montparnasse held in his hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part,
and the blade of a dagger made its appearance. Ah! he exclaimed, pushing the
dagger back in haste, you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a
bourgeois. Montparnasse winked. The deuce! resumed Gavroche, so youre going to
have a bout with the bobbies? You cant tell, replied Montparnasse with an
indifferent air. Its always a good thing to have a pin about one. Gavroche
persisted 1608 Les Miserables What are you up to to-night? Again Montparnasse
took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every syllable Things. And abruptly
changing the conversation By the way! What? Something happened tother day.
Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes me a present of a sermon and his purse. I
put it in my pocket. A minute later, I feel in my pocket. Theres nothing there.
Except the sermon, said Gavroche. But you, went on Montparnasse, where are you
bound for now? Gavroche pointed to his two proteges, and said Im going to put
these infants to bed. Whereabouts is the bed? At my house. Wheres your house?
At my house. So you have a lodging? Yes, I have. And where is your lodging? In
the elephant, said Gavroche. Montparnasse, though not naturally inclined to
astonishment, could not restrain an exclamation. In the elephant! Well, yes, in
the elephant! retorted Gavroche. Kekcaa? This is another word of the language
which no one writes, and which every one speaks. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1609 Kekcaa signifies Quest que cest que cela a? Whats the matter
with that? The urchins profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and
good sense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to Gavroches
lodging. Of course, said he, yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there? Very,
said Gavroche. Its really bully there. There aint any draughts, as there are
under the bridges. How do you get in? Oh, I get in. So there is a hole? demanded
Montparnasse. Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustnt tell. Its between the
fore legs. The bobbies havent seen it. And you climb up? Yes, I understand. A
turn of the hand, cric, crac, and its all over, no one there. After a pause,
Gavroche added I shall have a ladder for these children. Montparnasse burst out
laughing Where the devil did you pick up those young uns? Gavroche replied with
great simplicity They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of.
Meanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking You recognized me very readily,
he muttered. He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more
than two quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils. This
gave him a different nose. 1610 Les Miserables That changes you, remarked
Gavroche, you are less homely so, you ought to keep them on all the time.
Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease. Seriously,
demanded Montparnasse, how do you like me so? The sound of his voice was
different also. In a twinkling, Montparnasse had become unrecognizable. Oh! Do
play Porrichinelle for us! exclaimed Gavroche. The two children, who had not
been listening up to this point, being occupied themselves in thrusting their
fingers up their noses, drew near at this name, and stared at Montparnasse with
dawning joy and admiration. Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled. He laid
his hand on Gavroches shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing his words Listen
to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square with my dog, my knife, and my
wife, and if you were to squander ten sous on me, I wouldnt refuse to work, but
this isnt Shrove Tuesday. This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the
gamin. He wheeled round hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him
with profound attention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back
to them a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an Ah! good! to escape him, but
immediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasses hand Well, good evening,
said he, Im going off to my elephant with my brats. Supposing that you should
need me some night, you can come and hunt me up there. I lodge on Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1611 the entresol. There is no porter. You will inquire for
Monsieur Gavroche. Very good, said Montparnasse. And they parted, Montparnasse
betaking himself in the direction of the Greve, and Gavroche towards the
Bastille. The little one of five, dragged along by his brother who was dragged
by Gavroche, turned his head back several times to watch Porrichinelle as he
went. The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche
of the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than the
assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms. This syllable,
dig, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase, means
Take care, we can no longer talk freely. There was besides, in Montparnasses
sentence, a literary beauty which was lost upon Gavroche, that is mon dogue, ma
dague et ma digue, a slang expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my
knife, and my wife, greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the
great century when Moliere wrote and Callot drew. Twenty years ago, there was
still to be seen in the southwest corner of the Place de la Bastille, near the
basin of the canal, excavated in the ancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a
singular monument, which has already been effaced from the memories of
Parisians, and which deserved to leave some trace, for it was the idea of a
member of the Institute, the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt. We say
monument, although it was only a rough model. But this model itself, a
marvellous sketch, the grandiose 1612 Les Miserables skeleton of an idea of
Napoleons, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown, on each
occasion, still further from us, had become historical and had acquired a
certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect. It was an
elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber and masonry, bearing on its
back a tower which resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber,
and now painted black by heaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and
unprotected corner of the place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his
tusks, his tower, his enormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced,
at night, under the starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a
sort of symbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was
some mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect beside the
invisible spectre of the Bastille. Few strangers visited this edifice, no
passer-by looked at it. It was falling into ruins every season the plaster
which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. The
aediles, as the expression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since
1814. There it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded by
a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks meandered
athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass flourished
between its legs and, as the level of the place had been rising all around it
for a space of thirty years, by that slow and continuous movement which
insensibly elevates the soil of large towns, it stood in a hollow, and it
looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it. It was un- Free eBooks

eyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was
something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out, and
something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated. As we have
said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is the real element of everything
that is dark. As soon as twilight descended, the old elephant became
transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable
serenity of the shadows. Being of the past, he belonged to night and obscurity
was in keeping with his grandeur. This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost
misshapen, but assuredly majestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent
and savage gravity, has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of
gigantic stove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre
fortress with its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal
classes. It is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in
which a pot contains power. This epoch will pass away, people have already
begun to understand that, if there can be force in a boiler, there can be no
force except in the brain in other words, that which leads and drags on the
world, is not locomotives, but ideas. Harness locomotives to ideas, that is
well done but do not mistake the horse for the rider. At all events, to return
to the Place de la Bastille, the architect of this elephant succeeded in making
a grand thing out of plaster the architect of the stove has succeeded in making
a pretty thing out of bronze. 1614 Les Miserables This stove-pipe, which has
been baptized by a sonorous name, and called the column of July, this monument
of a revolution that miscarried, was still enveloped in 1832, in an immense
shirt of woodwork, which we regret, for our part, and by a vast plank
enclosure, which completed the task of isolating the elephant. It was towards
this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street
lamp, that the gamin guided his two brats. The reader must permit us to
interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality,
and that twenty years ago, the tribunals were called upon to judge, under the
charge of vagabondage, and mutilation of a public monument, a child who had
been caught asleep in this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we
proceed. On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the
effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small, and
said Dont be scared, infants. Then he entered through a gap in the fence into
the elephants enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the
breach. The two children, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without
uttering a word, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags
which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter. There, extended
along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the
neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor, and placed
it Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1615 against one of the elephants forelegs.
Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly of the
colossus could be distinguished. Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole
to his guests, and said to them Climb up and go in. The two little boys
exchanged terrified glances. Youre afraid, brats! exclaimed Gavroche. And he
added You shall see! He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a
twinkling, without deigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the
aperture. He entered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared
within, and an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,
appear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish
spectre. Well! he exclaimed, climb up, young uns! Youll see how snug it is
here! Come up, you! he said to the elder, Ill lend you a hand. The little
fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspired them with
confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was raining very hard. The
elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing his brother climbing up,
and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast, felt greatly
inclined to cry, but he did not dare. The elder lad climbed, with uncertain
steps, up the rungs of the ladder Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him
with exclamations like a fencing-master to his pupils, 1616 Les Miserables or a
muleteer to his mules. Dont be afraid!Thats it!Come on!Put your feet there!
Give us your hand here!Boldly! And when the child was within reach, he seized
him suddenly and vigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him. Nabbed!
said he. The brat had passed through the crack. Now, said Gavroche, wait for
me. Be so good as to take a seat, Monsieur. And making his way out of the hole
as he had entered it, he slipped down the elephants leg with the agility of a
monkey, landed on his feet in the grass, grasped the child of five round the
body, and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to
climb up behind him, shouting to the elder Im going to boost him, do you tug.
And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled, thrust,
stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself, and Gavroche,
entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on
the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry Here we are! Long live General
Lafayette! This explosion over, he added Now, young uns, you are in my house.
Gavroche was at home, in fact. Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity
of great things! Goodness of giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an
idea of the Emperors, had become the box Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1617
of a street urchin. The brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus.
The bourgeois decked out in their Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the
Bastille, were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their
prominent eyes Whats the good of that? It served to save from the cold, the
frost, the hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve
from slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the snow
which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother, no bread, no
clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed. It
served to diminish public crime. It was a lair open to one against whom all
doors were shut. It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon, invaded by
vermin and oblivion, covered with warts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering,
worm-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in
vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads, had taken pity on
that other mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,
without a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed on
rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good for. This
idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by God. That which had
been merely illustrious, had become august. In order to realize his thought,
the Emperor should have had porphyry, brass, iron, gold, marble the old
collection of planks, beams and plaster sufficed for God. The Emperor had had
the dream of a genius in that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk
uplifted, bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying
waters, 1618 Les Miserables he wished to incarnate the people. God had done a
grander thing with it, he had lodged a child there. The hole through which
Gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside,
being concealed, as we have stated, beneath the elephants belly, and so narrow
that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it. Lets
begin, said Gavroche, by telling the porter that we are not at home. And
plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well
acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the aperture.
Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the crackling of
the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical match was not yet in
existence at that epoch the Fumade steel represented progress. A sudden light
made them blink Gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord
dipped in resin which are called cellar rats. The cellar rat, which emitted
more smoke than light, rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly
visible. Gavroches two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they
experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the
great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must have felt in
the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeleton appeared
enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence started at regular distances,
massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebral column with its sides, stalac-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1619 tites of plaster depended from them like
entrails, and vast spiders webs stretching from side to side, formed dirty
diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were visible large blackish spots
which had the appearance of being alive, and which changed places rapidly with
an abrupt and frightened movement. Fragments which had fallen from the
elephants back into his belly had filled up the cavity, so that it was possible
to walk upon it as on a floor. The smaller child nestled up against his
brother, and whispered to him Its black. This remark drew an exclamation from
Gavroche. The petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary.
Whats that you are gabbling about there? he exclaimed. Are you scoffing at me?
Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the tuileries? Are you brutes? Come,
say! I warn you that I dont belong to the regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now,
are you brats from the Popes establishment? A little roughness is good in cases
of fear. It is reassuring. The two children drew close to Gavroche. Gavroche,
paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave to gentle, and
addressing the smaller Stupid, said he, accenting the insulting word, with a
caressing intonation, its outside that it is black. Outside its raining, here
it does not rain outside its cold, here theres not an atom of wind outside
there are heaps of people, here theres no one outside there aint even the moon,
here 1620 Les Miserables theres my candle, confound it! The two children began
to look upon the apartment with less terror but Gavroche allowed them no more
time for contemplation. Quick, said he. And he pushed them towards what we are
very glad to be able to call the end of the room. There stood his bed.
Gavroches bed was complete that is to say, it had a mattress, a blanket, and an
alcove with curtains. The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large
strip of gray woollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove
consisted of Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the
rubbish which formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two
in front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as to form a
pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass wire which was
simply placed upon it, but artistically applied, and held by fastenings of iron
wire, so that it enveloped all three holes. A row of very heavy stones kept
this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it. This grating
was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are
covered in menageries. Gavroches bed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The
whole resembled an Esquimaux tent. This trellis-work took the place of
curtains. Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,
and the two folds of the net which lapped Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1621
over each other fell apart. Down on all fours, brats! said Gavroche. He made
his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawled in after them,
pulled the stones together, and closed the opening hermetically again. All
three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the cellar rat in his
hand. Now, said he, go to sleep! Im going to suppress the candelabra. Monsieur,
the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the netting, whats that
for? That, answered Gavroche gravely, is for the rats. Go to sleep!
Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit
of these young creatures, and he continued Its a thing from the Jardin des
Plantes. Its used for fierce animals. Theres a whole shopful of them there. All
youve got to do is to climb over a wall, crawl through a window, and pass
through a door. You can get as much as you want. As he spoke, he wrapped the
younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket, and the little one murmured Oh!
how good that is! Its warm! Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket. Thats
from the Jardin des Plantes, too, said he. I took that from the monkeys. And,
pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very thick and
admirably made mat, he added 1622 Les Miserables That belonged to the giraffe.
After a pause he went on The beasts had all these things. I took them away from
them. It didnt trouble them. I told them Its for the elephant. He paused, and
then resumed You crawl over the walls and you dont care a straw for the
government. So there now! The two children gazed with timid and stupefied
respect on this intrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves,
isolated like themselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirable
and all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose
physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank, mingled with
the most ingenuous and charming smiles. Monsieur, ventured the elder timidly,
you are not afraid of the police, then? Gavroche contented himself with
replying Brat! Nobody says police, they say bobbies. The smaller had his eyes
wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on the edge of the mat, the elder
being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might
have done, and heightened the mat under his head with old rags, in such a way
as to form a pillow for the child. Then he turned to the elder Hey! Were jolly
comfortable here, aint we? Ah, yes! replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with
the expression of a saved angel. The two poor little children who had been
soaked Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1623 through, began to grow warm once more.
Ah, by the way, continued Gavroche, what were you bawling about? And pointing
out the little one to his brother A mite like that, Ive nothing to say about,
but the idea of a big fellow like you crying! Its idiotic you looked like a
calf. Gracious, replied the child, we have no lodging. Bother! retorted
Gavroche, you dont say lodgings, you say crib. And then, we were afraid of
being alone like that at night. You dont say night, you say darkmans. Thank
you, sir, said the child. Listen, went on Gavroche, you must never bawl again
over anything. Ill take care of you. You shall see what fun well have. In
summer, well go to the Glaciere with Navet, one of my pals, well bathe in the
Gare, well run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz,that
makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get mad, and if you only knew
how ridiculous they are! Well go and see the man-skeleton. And then Ill take
you to the play. Ill take you to see Frederick Lemaitre. I have tickets, I know
some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot of us
fellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea. Ill get you an
engagement at my theatre. Well go to see the savages. They aint real, those
savages aint. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see
where their elbows have been darned with white. Then, 1624 Les Miserables well
go to the Opera. Well get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is
well managed. I wouldnt associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the Opera,
just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but theyre ninnies. Theyre called
dishclouts. And then well go to see the guillotine work. Ill show you the
executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. He has a
letter-box at his door. Ah! well have famous fun! At that moment a drop of wax
fell on Gavroches finger, and recalled him to the realities of life. The deuce!
said he, theres the wick giving out. Attention! I cant spend more than a sou a
month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed, he must sleep. We havent the
time to read M. Paul de Kocks romances. And besides, the light might pass
through the cracks of the porte-cochere, and all the bobbies need to do is to
see it. And then, remarked the elder timidly,he alone dared talk to Gavroche,
and reply to him, a spark might fall in the straw, and we must look out and not
burn the house down. People dont say burn the house down, remarked Gavroche,
they say blaze the crib. The storm increased in violence, and the heavy
downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder. Youre taken
in, rain! said Gavroche. It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of
the house. Winter is a stupid it wastes its merchandise, it loses its labor, it
cant wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, old water-carrier that it is.
This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1625 which Gavroche, in his character of a philosopher of the
nineteenth century, accepted, was followed by a broad flash of lightning, so
dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack.
Almost at the same instant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little
creatures uttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network came
near being displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them, and took
advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh. Calm down, children.
Dont topple over the edifice. Thats fine, first-class thunder all right. Thats
no slouch of a streak of lightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! Its
almost as good as it is at the Ambigu. That said, he restored order in the
netting, pushed the two children gently down on the bed, pressed their knees,
in order to stretch them out at full length, and exclaimed Since the good God
is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now, babes, now, my young humans,
you must shut your peepers. Its very bad not to sleep. Itll make you swallow
the strainer, or, as they say, in fashionable society, stink in the gullet.
Wrap yourself up well in the hide! Im going to put out the light. Are you
ready? Yes, murmured the elder, Im all right. I seem to have feathers under my
head. People dont say head, cried Gavroche, they say nut. The two children
nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished arranging them on the mat, drew
the blanket up to their very ears, then repeated, for the third time, his
injunction in the hieratical tongue 1626 Les Miserables Shut your peepers! And
he snuffed out his tiny light. Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a
peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children
lay. It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic
sound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was
accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries. The little five-year-old
boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and chilled with terror, jogged his
brothers elbow but the elder brother had already shut his peepers, as Gavroche
had ordered. Then the little one, who could no longer control his terror,
questioned Gavroche, but in a very low tone, and with bated breath Sir? Hey?
said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes. What is that? Its the rats,
replied Gavroche. And he laid his head down on the mat again. The rats, in fact,
who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant, and who were the
living black spots which we have already mentioned, had been held in awe by the
flame of the candle, so long as it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern,
which was the same as their city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the
good story-teller Perrault calls fresh meat, they had hurled themselves in
throngs on Gavroches tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun to bite
the meshes as though seeking to pierce Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1627
this new-fangled trap. Still the little one could not sleep. Sir? he began
again. Hey? said Gavroche. What are rats? They are mice. This explanation
reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice in the course of his life,
and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, he lifted up his voice once more.
Sir? Hey? said Gavroche again. Why dont you have a cat? I did have one, replied
Gavroche, I brought one here, but they ate her. This second explanation undid
the work of the first, and the little fellow began to tremble again. The
dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time Monsieur?
Hey? Who was it that was eaten? The cat. And who ate the cat? The rats. The
mice? Yes, the rats. The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of
mice which ate cats, pursued Sir, would those mice eat us? 1628 Les Miserables
Wouldnt they just! ejaculated Gavroche. The childs terror had reached its
climax. But Gavroche added Dont be afraid. They cant get in. And besides, Im
here! Here, catch hold of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers! At
the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellows hand across his brother. The
child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured. Courage and strength
have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves. Silence reigned round
them once more, the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats at the
expiration of a few minutes, they came raging back, but in vain, the three
little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more. The hours of the night
fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la Bastille. A wintry gale, which
mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, the patrol searched all the doorways,
alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks, and in their search for nocturnal
vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant the monster, erect,
motionless, staring open-eyed into the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming
happily over his good deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three
poor sleeping children. In order to understand what is about to follow, the
reader must remember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was
situated at the other end of the square, and that what took place in the
vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.
Towards the end of that hour which immediately pre- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1629 cedes the dawn, a man turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a
run, made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of July, and glided between
the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had
illuminated that man, it might have been divined from the thorough manner in
which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneath
the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to any human
tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice he repeated this
cry, of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea Kirikikiou! At
the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly of the
elephant Yes! Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn
aside, and gave passage to a child who descended the elephants leg, and fell
briskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse. As for his cry
of Kirikikiou,that was, doubtless, what the child had meant, when he said You
will ask for Monsieur Gavroche. On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had
crawled out of his alcove, pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully
drawing it together again, then he had opened the trap, and descended. The man
and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom Montparnasse
confined himself to the remark 1630 Les Miserables We need you. Come, lend us a
hand. The lad asked for no further enlightenment. Im with you, said he. And
both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence Montparnasse had
emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of market-gardeners carts which
descend towards the markets at that hour. The market-gardeners, crouching,
half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the salads and vegetables, enveloped to
their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain, did not even
glance at these strange pedestrians. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1631
CHAPTER III THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT This is what had taken place that same
night at the La Force An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon,
Guelemer, and Thenardier, although Thenardier was in close confinement. Babet
had arranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the reader has
seen from Montparnasses account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to help them from
outside. Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had
time, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a plan. In
former times, those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers
the convict into his own hands, were composed of four stone walls, a stone
ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated window, and a door lined with
iron, and were called dungeons but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible
nowadays they are composed of an iron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a
flagged pavement, four stone walls, and 1632 Les Miserables a stone ceiling,
and are called chambers of punishment. A little light penetrates towards
mid-day. The inconvenient point about these chambers which, as the reader sees,
are not dungeons, is that they allow the persons who should be at work to
think. So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with
a rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne
courtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found in the
New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail Guelemer, that is to say,
crime a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it is high time that the
reader should have a complete idea, was, with an appearance of delicate health
and a profoundly premeditated languor, a polished, intelligent sprig, and a
thief, who had a caressing glance, and an atrocious smile. His glance resulted
from his will, and his smile from his nature. His first studies in his art had
been directed to roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men
who tear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process
called double pickings. The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the
moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were
re-laying and re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the
prison. The SaintBernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the
Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were scaffoldings and
ladders in other words, bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty. The New
Building, which was the most cracked and de- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1633 crepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the
prison. The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the
authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a
sheathing of wood, because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and
falling on the prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the
authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most
troublesome prisoners, of placing there the hard cases, as they say in prison
parlance. The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and
a top story which was called the BelAir FineAir. A large chimney-flue, probably
from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, started from the
groundfloor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories, where it figured
as a flattened pillar, into two portions, and finally pierced the roof.
Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, by way of
precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads of their beds
should rest against the chimney. Thenardier was directly over their heads in
the top story known as Fine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue
Culture-Sainte-Catherine, after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front
of the porte-cochere of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of
flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a
little white rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the
bucolic dream of Jean Jacques. Not more than ten years ago, there rose above
that ro- 1634 Les Miserables tunda an enormous black, hideous, bare wall by
which it was backed up. This was the outer wall of La Force. This wall, beside
that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin. Lofty as it was, this wall was
overtopped by a still blacker roof, which could be seen beyond. This was the
roof of the New Building. There one could descry four dormerwindows, guarded
with bars they were the windows of the Fine-Air. A chimney pierced the roof
this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories. The Bel-Air, that top
story of the New Building, was a sort of large hall, with a Mansard roof,
guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron, which were studded
with enormous bolts. When one entered from the north end, one had on ones left
the four dormer-windows, on ones right, facing the windows, at regular
intervals, four square, tolerably vast cages, separated by narrow passages,
built of masonry to about the height of the elbow, and the rest, up to the
roof, of iron bars. Thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these
cages since the night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover
how, and by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a bottle
of wine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with which a narcotic is mixed,
and which the band of the Endormeurs, or Sleepcompellers, rendered famous.
There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1635 jailers, half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the
police an unfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can. On that
same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost children, Brujon
and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped that morning, was waiting
for them in the street as well as Montparnasse, rose softly, and with the nail
which Brujon had found, began to pierce the chimney against which their beds
stood. The rubbish fell on Brujons bed, so that they were not heard. Showers
mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges, and created in the prison
a terrible and opportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to
fall asleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices. Brujon
was adroit Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached the watcher, who
was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory, the wall had,
been pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron grating which barred the upper
orifice of the flue forced, and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof.
The wind and rain redoubled, the roof was slippery. What a good night to leg
it! said Brujon. An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them
from the surrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the
musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of the
rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which
they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the outer wall, crossed the
abyss at one bound, clung to the cop- 1636 Les Miserables ing of the wall, got
astride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other, along the rope, upon a
little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled their rope after them, jumped
down into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it, pushed open the
porters wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled this, opened the
porte-cochere, and found themselves in the street. Three-quarters of an hour had
not elapsed since they had risen in bed in the dark, nail in hand, and their
project in their heads. A few moments later they had joined Babet and
Montparnasse, who were prowling about the neighborhood. They had broken their
rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney
on the roof. They had sustained no other damage, however, than that of
scratching nearly all the skin off their hands. That night, Thenardier was
warned, without any one being able to explain how, and was not asleep. Towards
one oclock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw two shadows pass
along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of the dormer-window which
was opposite his cage. One halted at the window, long enough to dart in a glance.
This was Brujon. Thenardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.
Thenardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precaution under
the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force, was kept in
sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, marched up and down Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1637 in front of his cage with loaded musket. The
Fine-Air was lighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet fetters
weighing fifty pounds. Every day, at four oclock in the afternoon, a jailer,
escorted by two dogs,this was still in vogue at that time,entered his cage,
deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds, a jug of
water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, in which swam a few Mayagan beans,
inspected his irons and tapped the bars. This man and his dogs made two visits
during the night. Thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron
bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, in order to
preserve it from the rats, as he said. As Thenardier was kept in sight, no
objection had been made to this spike. Still, it was remembered afterwards,
that one of the jailers had said It would be better to let him have only a
wooden spike. At two oclock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old
soldier, was relieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the
man with the dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything,
except, possibly, the excessive youth and the rustic air of the raw recruit.
Two hours afterwards, at four oclock, when they came to relieve the conscript,
he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log near Thenardiers cage. As
for Thenardier, he was no longer there. There was a hole in the ceiling of his
cage, and, above it, another hole in the roof. One of the planks of his bed had
been wrenched off, and probably carried away with him, as it was not found.
They also seized in his cell a halfempty bottle which contained the remains of
the stupefying 1638 Les Miserables wine with which the soldier had been
drugged. The soldiers bayonet had disappeared. At the moment when this
discovery was made, it was assumed that Thenardier was out of reach. The truth
is, that he was no longer in the New Building, but that he was still in great danger.
Thenardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found the remains of
Brujons rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney, but, as this
broken fragment was much too short, he had not been able to escape by the outer
wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done. When one turns from the Rue des Ballets
into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, one almost immediately encounters a repulsive
ruin. There stood on that spot, in the last century, a house of which only the
back wall now remains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of
the third story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be recognized by
two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle one, that
nearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop.
Through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall,
which was a fragment of the outer wall of La Force. The empty space on the
street left by the demolished house is half-filled by a fence of rotten boards,
shored up by five stone posts. In this recess lies concealed a little shanty
which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing. The
fence has a gate, which, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1639 It was the crest of this ruin that Thenardier
had succeeded in reaching, a little after one oclock in the morning. How had he
got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand. The
lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and helped him. Had he made use
of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof, from
enclosure to enclosure, from compartment to compartment, to the buildings of
the Charlemagne court, then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the
outer wall, and thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that
itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had
he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air to
the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping of the outer wall
the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut? But the outer wall of La
Force formed a crenellated and unequal line it mounted and descended, it
dropped at the firemens barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, it was cut in
twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon
as on the Rue Pavee everywhere occurred falls and right angles and then, the
sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence, the route taken
by Thenardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was
impossible. Had Thenardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes
precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a legless man into an
athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into
intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had Thenardier invented a third
mode? No one has ever found out. 1640 Les Miserables The marvels of escape
cannot always be accounted for. The man who makes his escape, we repeat, is
inspired there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious
gleam of flight the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the
flight towards the sublime, and one says of the escaped thief How did he
contrive to scale that wall? in the same way that one says of Corneille Where
did he find the means of dying? At all events, dripping with perspiration,
drenched with rain, with his clothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his
elbows bleeding, his knees torn, Thenardier had reached what children, in their
figurative language, call the edge of the wall of the ruin, there he had
stretched himself out at full length, and there his strength had failed him. A
steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the
street. The rope which he had was too short. There he waited, pale, exhausted,
desperate with all the despair which he had undergone, still hidden by the
night, but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at
the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a
few minutes, an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would
be found asleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth,
at the light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavement
longed for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty. He asked
himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded, if they had
heard him, and if they would Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1641 come to his
assistance. He listened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed
through the street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of
the market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes, and from
Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue Saint-Antoine. Four
oclock struck. Thenardier shuddered. A few moments later, that terrified and
confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the
prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, the creaking of gratings on
their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys,
the shock of musketbutts on the pavement of the courts, reached his ears.
Lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories, a
torch ran along the ridge-pole of the top story of the New Building, the
firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned. Their
helmets, which the torch lighted up in the rain, went and came along the roofs.
At the same time, Thenardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan
whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise. He was on top of a
wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy rains, with two gulfs to
right and left, unable to stir, subject to the giddiness of a possible fall,
and to the horror of a certain arrest, and his thoughts, like the pendulum of a
clock, swung from one of these ideas to the other Dead if I fall, caught if I
stay. In the midst of this anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still
dark, a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue 1642 Les
Miserables Pavee, halt in the recess above which Thenardier was, as it were,
suspended. Here this man was joined by a second, who walked with the same
caution, then by a third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one
of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the
enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under Thenardier.
These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might
consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the
wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It must be added, that the rain kept
this sentinel blocked in his box. Thenardier, not being able to distinguish
their visages, lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a
wretch who feels himself lost. Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of
hope flash before his eyes,these men conversed in slang. The first said in a
low but distinct voice Lets cut. What are we up to here? The second replied Its
raining hard enough to put out the very devils fire. And the bobbies will be
along instanter. Theres a soldier on guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here.
These two words, icigo and icicaille, both of which mean ici, and which belong,
the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the slang of the Temple,
were flashes of light for Thenardier. By the icigo he recognized Brujon, who
was a prowler of the barriers, by the icicaille he knew Babet, who, among his
other trades, had been an old-clothes broker at the Temple. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1643 The antique slang of the great century is no longer
spoken except in the Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it
in all its purity. Had it not been for the icicaille, Thenardier would not have
recognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice. In the meanwhile, the
third man had intervened. Theres no hurry yet, lets wait a bit. How do we know
that he doesnt stand in need of us? By this, which was nothing but French,
Thenardier recognized Montparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to
understand all slangs and to speak none of them. As for the fourth, he held his
peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed him. Thenardier did not hesitate. It was
Guelemer. Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone What are
you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasnt managed to cut his stick. He dont
tumble to the racket, that he dont! You have to be a pretty knowing cove to
tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to make a rope, punch holes in doors, get
up false papers, make false keys, file your irons, hang out your cord, hide
yourself, and disguise yourself! The old fellow hasnt managed to play it, he
doesnt understand how to work the business. Babet added, still in that
classical slang which was spoken by Poulailler and Cartouche, and which is to
the bold, new, highly colored and risky argot used by Brujon what the language
of Racine is to the language of Andre Chenier Your tavern-keeper must have been
nabbed in the act. 1644 Les Miserables You have to be knowing. Hes only a
greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken in by a bobby, perhaps even by a
sheep who played it on him as his pal. Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those
shouts in the prison? You have seen all those lights. Hes recaptured, there!
Hell get off with twenty years. I aint afraid, I aint a coward, but there aint
anything more to do, or otherwise theyd lead us a dance. Dont get mad, come
with us, lets go drink a bottle of old wine together. One doesnt desert ones
friends in a scrape, grumbled Montparnasse. I tell you hes nabbed! retorted
Brujon. At the present moment, the inn-keeper aint worth a hapenny. We cant do
nothing for him. Lets be off. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his
fist. Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact is,
that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each
other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as was their peril, in
the hope of seeing Thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall. But
the night, which was really growing too fine,for the downpour was such as to
render all the streets deserted,the cold which was overpowering them, their
soaked garments, their hole-ridden shoes, the alarming noise which had just
burst forth in the prison, the hours which had elapsed, the patrol which they
had encountered, the hope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a
retreat. Montparnasse himself, who was, perhaps, almost Thenardiers son-in-law,
yielded. A moment more, and they Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1645 would be
gone. Thenardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the
Meduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight
vanish on the horizon. He dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin
everything. An idea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration he
drew from his pocket the end of Brujons rope, which he had detached from the
chimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence.
This rope fell at their feet. A widow,37 said Babet. 37 Argot of the Temple. My
tortouse!38 said Brujon. 38 Argot of the barriers. The tavern-keeper is there,
said Montparnasse. They raised their eyes. Thenardier thrust out his head a
very little. Quick! said Montparnasse, have you the other end of the rope,
Brujon? Yes. Knot the two pieces together, well fling him the rope, he can fasten
it to the wall, and hell have enough of it to get down with. Thenardier ran the
risk, and spoke I am paralyzed with cold. Well warm you up. I cant budge. Let
yourself slide, well catch you. My hands are benumbed. 1646 Les Miserables Only
fasten the rope to the wall. I cant. Then one of us must climb up, said
Montparnasse. Three stories! ejaculated Brujon. An ancient plaster flue, which
had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times, ran
along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see
Thenardier. This flue, then much damaged and full of cracks, has since fallen,
but the marks of it are still visible. It was very narrow. One might get up by
the help of that, said Montparnasse. By that flue? exclaimed Babet, a grown-up
cove, never! it would take a brat. A brat must be got, resumed Brujon. Where
are we to find a young un? said Guelemer. Wait, said Montparnasse. Ive got the
very article. He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no
one was passing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behind
him, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille. Seven or eight
minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thenardier Babet, Brujon, and
Guelemer did not open their lips at last the gate opened once more, and
Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed by Gavroche. The rain still
rendered the street completely deserted. Little Gavroche entered the enclosure
and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air. The water was
dripping from his hair. Guelemer addressed him Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1647 Are you a man, young un? Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied A
young un like mes a man, and men like you are babes. The brats tongues well
hung! exclaimed Babet. The Paris brat aint made of straw, added Brujon. What do
you want? asked Gavroche. Montparnasse answered Climb up that flue. With this
rope, said Babet. And fasten it, continued Brujon. To the top of the wall, went
on Babet. To the cross-bar of the window, added Brujon. And then? said
Gavroche. There! said Guelemer. The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the
wall, the windows, and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his
lips which signifies Is that all! Theres a man up there whom you are to save,
resumed Montparnasse. Will you? began Brujon again. Greenhorn! replied the lad,
as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him. And he took
off his shoes. Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the
shanty, whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchins weight, and handed him
the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasses absence. The
1648 Les Miserables gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was
easy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the moment
when he was on the point of ascending, Thenardier, who saw life and safety
approaching, bent over the edge of the wall the first light of dawn struck
white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid cheek-bones, his sharp
and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and Gavroche recognized him. Hullo!
its my father! Oh, that wont hinder. And taking the rope in his teeth, he
resolutely began the ascent. He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old
wall as though it had been a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper
cross-bar of the window. A moment later, Thenardier was in the street. As soon
as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out of danger, he was
no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling the terrible things from which
he had escaped vanished like smoke, all that strange and ferocious mind awoke
once more, and stood erect and free, ready to march onward. These were this
mans first words Now, whom are we to eat? It is useless to explain the sense of
this frightfully transparent remark, which signifies both to kill, to
assassinate, and to plunder. To eat, true sense to devour. Lets get well into a
corner, said Brujon. Lets settle it in three words, and part at once. There was
an affair that promised well in the Rue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolat-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1649 ed house, an old rotten gate on a garden,
and lone women. Well! why not? demanded Thenardier. Your girl, Eponine, went to
see about the matter, replied Babet. And she brought a biscuit to Magnon, added
Guelemer. Nothing to be made there. The girls no fool, said Thenardier. Still,
it must be seen to. Yes, yes, said Brujon, it must be looked up. In the
meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during this colloquy,
had seated himself on one of the fence-posts he waited a few moments, thinking
that perhaps his father would turn towards him, then he put on his shoes again,
and said Is that all? You dont want any more, my men? Now youre out of your
scrape. Im off. I must go and get my brats out of bed. And off he went. The
five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure. When Gavroche had
disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets, Babet took Thenardier aside.
Did you take a good look at that young un? he asked. What young un? The one who
climbed the wall and carried you the rope. Not particularly. Well, I dont know,
but it strikes me that it was your son. Bah! said Thenardier, do you think so?

Where are we at this moment? In the land of slang. What is slang? It is at one
and the same time, a nation and a dialect it is theft in its two kinds people
and language. When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and

thief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.What! How! Argot! Why,
argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of
everything that is most abominable in society! etc., etc. 39 The Last Day of a
Condemned Man. We have never understood this sort of objections. Since that
time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound observer of the human
heart, the other an in- 1652 Les Miserables trepid friend of the people, Balzac
and Eugene Sue, having represented their ruffians as talking their natural

revolting dialect? Slang is odious! Slang makes one shudder! Who denies that?
Of course it does. When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society,
since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We
have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, a
simple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted
and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything, and study
everything? Why should one halt on the way? The halt is a matter depending on
the soundingline, and not on the leadsman. Certainly, too, it is neither an
attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest
depths of the social order, where terra firma comes to an end and where mud
begins, to rummage in those vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to
fling, still quivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping
with filth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary each word
of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows.
Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the
broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang. It seems, in fact,
to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from
its cesspool. One thinks one beholds Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1653 a
frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers,
returns to shadow, threatens and glares. One word resembles a claw, another an
extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the
claw of a crab. All this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which
have been organized out of disorganization. Now, when has horror ever excluded
study? Since when has malady banished medicine? Can one imagine a naturalist
refusing to study the viper, the bat, the scorpion, the centipede, the
tarantula, and one who would cast them back into their darkness, saying Oh! how
ugly that is! The thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a
surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be like a
philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to
scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant
of the case, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result. What
is slang, properly speaking? It is the language of wretchedness. We may be
stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating
it we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the
accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own
slang. The merchant who says Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality,
the broker on change who says Assets at end of current month, the gambler who
says Tiers et tout, refait de pique, the sheriff of the Norman Isles who says
The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the fruits of
that estate during the hereditary seizure 1654 Les Miserables of the real
estate by the mortgagor, the playwright who says The piece was hissed, the
comedian who says Ive made a hit, the philosopher who says Phenomenal
triplicity, the huntsman who says Voileci allais, Voileci fuyant, the phrenologist
who says Amativeness, combativeness, secretiveness, the infantry soldier who
says My shooting-iron, the cavalry-man who says My turkey-cock, the
fencingmaster who says Tierce, quarte, break, the printer who says My
shooting-stick and galley,all, printer, fencing-master, cavalry dragoon,
infantry-man, phrenologist, huntsman, philosopher, comedian, playwright,
sheriff, gambler, stockbroker, and merchant, speak slang. The painter who says
My grinder, the notary who says My Skip-the-Gutter, the hairdresser who says My
mealyback, the cobbler who says My cub, talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one
absolutely insists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right
and the left, the sailors port and starboard, the scene-shifters court-side,
and garden-side, the beadles Gospel-side and Epistle-side, are slang. There is
the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses. The Hotel
Rambouillet nearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles. There is a slang of
duchesses, witness this phrase contained in a love-letter from a very great
lady and a very pretty woman of the Restoration You will find in this gossip a
fultitude of reasons why I should libertize.40 Diplomatic ciphers are slang the
pontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome, grkztntgzyal for despatch, and
abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI. for the Due de Modena, speaks slang. The physicians of
the Middle Ages who, for carrot, radish, and turnip, said Opoponach, Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1655 perfroschinum, reptitalmus, dracatholicum,
angelorum, postmegorum, talked slang. The sugar-manufacturer who says Loaf,
clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,this honest manufacturer talks slang.
A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say Half of the
works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns, talked slang. The
poet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designate M. de
Montmorency as a bourgeois, if he were not a judge of verses and statues, speak
slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers Flora, fruits, Pomona, the
sea, Neptune, love, fires, beauty, charms, a horse, a courser, the white or
tricolored cockade, the rose of Bellona, the three-cornered hat, Mars
triangle,that classical Academician talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany,
have each their slang. The tongue which is employed on board ship, that
wonderful language of the sea, which is so complete and so picturesque, which
was spoken by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperre, which mingles with the
whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, the shock of the
boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale, the cannon, is wholly
a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what
the lion is to the jackal. 40 Vous trouverez dans ces potains-la, une
foultitude de raisons pour que je me libertise. No doubt. But say what we will,
this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one
will not admit. For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient and precise,
circumscribed and determined significance, 1656 Les Miserables and we restrict
slang to slang. The veritable slang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang,
if the two words can be coupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom,
is nothing else, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous,
venomous, cruel, equivocal, vile, profound, fatal tongue of wretchedness. There
exists, at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes, a last misery
which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass
of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful conflict, where, now cunning,
now violent, unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time, it attacks the
social order with pin-pricks through vice, and with club-blows through crime.
To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of
combat, which is slang. To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold
above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken
and which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good
or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to
extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself. This
service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two
Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician that service Moliere rendered, by making
so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects. Here
objections spring up afresh. Phoenician, very good! Levantine, quite right!
Even dialect, let that pass! They are tongues which have belonged to nations or
provinces but slang! What is the use of preserving slang? What is the good of
assisting slang to survive? Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1657 To this we
reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which a nation or a province
has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has been spoken by a
misery is still more worthy of attention and study. It is the language which
has been spoken, in France, for example, for more than four centuries, not only
by a misery, but by every possible human misery. And then, we insist upon it,
the study of social deformities and infirmities, and the task of pointing them
out with a view to remedy, is not a business in which choice is permitted. The
historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian
of events. The latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of crowns,
the births of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, great
public men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior the other
historian has the interior, the depths, the people who toil, suffer, wait, the
oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the secret war between man and man,
obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted iniquities, the subterranean, the
indistinct tremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the
law, the secret evolution of souls, the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the
disinherited, the orphans, the unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms which
roam through the darkness. He must descend with his heart full of charity, and
severity at the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those impenetrable
casemates where crawl, pellmell, those who bleed and those who deal the blow,
those who weep and those who curse, those who fast and those who devour, those
who endure evil and those who inflict it. 1658 Les Miserables Have these
historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of
external facts? Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say
than Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization any less important than the
upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre? Do we really know the
mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern? Let us say, moreover,
parenthetically, that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation
might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in
our mind. No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, striking, and
public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure,
the historian of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of
the interior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the
exterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of
events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute two different orders of
facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which
often bring forth results. All the lineaments which providence traces on the
surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths,
and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface. True
history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in
everything. Man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a
double focus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other. Slang is nothing
but a dressing-room where the tongue Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1659
having some bad action to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself in
word-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible. One finds it
difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, the great human tongue?
Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime, and prepared
for all the employments of the repertory of evil. It no longer walks, it
hobbles it limps on the crutch of the Court of Miracles, a crutch
metamorphosable into a club it is called vagrancy every sort of spectre, its
dressers, have painted its face, it crawls and rears, the double gait of the
reptile. Henceforth, it is apt at all roles, it is made suspicious by the
counterfeiter, covered with verdigris by the forger, blacked by the soot of the
incendiary and the murderer applies its rouge. When one listens, by the side of
honest men, at the portals of society, one overhears the dialogues of those who
are on the outside. One distinguishes questions and replies. One perceives,
without understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents,
but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. It is slang. The
words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality.
One thinks one hears hydras talking. It is unintelligible in the dark. It
gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery. It is black in
misfortune, it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated,
compose slang. Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in
voices. Terrible, toad-like tongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls,
slobbers, and 1660 Les Miserables stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense
gray fog composed of rain and night, of hunger, of vice, of falsehood, of
injustice, of nudity, of suffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.
Let us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? Who am I
who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? And are you very sure
that we have done nothing before we were born? The earth is not devoid of
resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender
against divine justice? Look closely at life. It is so made, that everywhere we
feel the sense of punishment. Are you what is called a happy man? Well! you are
sad every day. Each day has its own great grief or its little care. Yesterday
you were trembling for a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear for your
own to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrow the
diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of some friend then
the prevailing weather, then something that has been broken or lost, then a
pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you
again, the course of public affairs. This without reckoning in the pains of the
heart. And so it goes on. One cloud is dispelled, another forms. There is
hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny. And you
belong to that small class who are happy! As for the rest of mankind,
stagnating night rests upon them. Thoughtful minds make but little use of the
phrase the fortunate and the unfortunate. In this world, evidently the Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1661 vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
The real human division is this the luminous and the shady. To diminish the
number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,that is the object.
That is why we cry Education! science! To teach reading, means to light the
fire every syllable spelled out sparkles. However, he who says light does not,
necessarily, say joy. People suffer in the light excess burns. The flame is the
enemy of the wing. To burn without ceasing to fly,therein lies the marvel of
genius. When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still
suffer. The day is born in tears. The luminous weep, if only over those in
darkness. 1662 Les Miserables CHAPTER II ROOTS Slang is the tongue of those who
sit in darkness. Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy
is bidden to its most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic
dialect at once so blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisement made
visible. Every syllable has an air of being marked. The words of the vulgar
tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were, beneath the hot iron
of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking. Such and such a phrase
produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the
fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare. Ideas almost refuse to be
expressed in these substantives which are fugitives from justice. Metaphor is
sometimes so shameless, that one feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.
Moreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strange dialect
has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon-holes
where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal, and
which is called literature. Slang, whether the public admit the fact or not has
its syntax and its poetry. It is a language. Yes, by Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1663 the deformity of certain terms, we recognize the fact that it
was chewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certain metonymies, we feel that
Villon spoke it. That exquisite and celebrated verse Mais ou sont les neiges
dantan? But where are the snows of years gone by? is a verse of slang.
Antamante annumis a word of Thunes slang, which signified the past year, and by
extension, formerly. Thirty-five years ago, at the epoch of the departure of
the great chain-gang, there could be read in one of the cells at Bicetre, this
maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to the
galleys Les dabs dantan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du Coesre. This means
Kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed. In the opinion
of that king, anointment meant the galleys. The word decarade, which expresses
the departure of heavy vehicles at a gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is
worthy of him. This word, which strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up
in a masterly onomatopoeia the whole of La Fontaines admirable verse Six forts
chevaux tiraient un coche. Six stout horses drew a coach. From a purely
literary point of view, few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than
the study of slang. It is 1664 Les Miserables a whole language within a
language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft which has produced a
vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in the old Gallic trunk, and whose
sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language. This is what may be
called the first, the vulgar aspect of slang. But, for those who study the
tongue as it should be studied, that is to say, as geologists study the earth,
slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer
or shorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below the old popular French,
Provencal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean
ports, English and German, the Romance language in its three varieties, French,
Italian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. A profound
and unique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the
miserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has
dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. A throng of
evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed life and have vanished into
eternity, linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some
monstrous word. Do you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here
is boffete, a box on the ear, which is derived from bofeton vantane, window
later on vanterne, which comes from vantana gat, cat, which comes from gato
acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. Do you want Italian? Here is spade, sword,
which comes from spada carvel, boat, which comes from caravella. Do you want
English? Here is bichot, which comes from bishop raille, spy, which comes from
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1665 rascal, rascalion pilche, a case, which
comes from pilcher, a sheath. Do you want German? Here is the caleur, the
waiter, kellner the hers, the master, herzog duke. Do you want Latin? Here is
frangir, to break, frangere affurer, to steal, fur cadene, chain, catena. There
is one word which crops up in every language of the continent, with a sort of
mysterious power and authority. It is the word magnus the Scotchman makes of it
his mac, which designates the chief of the clan Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the
great Farlane, the great Callumore41 slang turns it into meck and later le meg,
that is to say, God. Would you like Basque? Here is gahisto, the devil, which
comes from gaiztoa, evil sorgabon, good night, which comes from gabon, good
evening. Do you want Celtic? Here is blavin, a handkerchief, which comes from
blavet, gushing water menesse, a woman in a bad sense, which comes from meinec,
full of stones barant, brook, from baranton, fountain goffeur, locksmith, from
goff, blacksmith guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du, black-white.
Finally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns les malteses, a souvenir of
the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta. 41 It must be observed,
however, that mac in Celtic means son. In addition to the philological origins
just indicated, slang possesses other and still more natural roots, which
spring, so to speak, from the mind of man itself. In the first place, the
direct creation of words. Therein lies the mystery of tongues. To paint with
words, which contains figures one knows not how or why, is the primi- 1666 Les
Miserables tive foundation of all human languages, what may be called their
granite. Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, words
created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without
etymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous, sometimes
hideous words, which at times possess a singular power of expression and which
live. The executioner, le taule the forest, le sabri fear, flight, taf the
lackey, le larbin the mineral, the prefect, the minister, pharos the devil, le
rabouin. Nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some,
le rabouin, for example, are at the same time grotesque and terrible, and
produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace. In the second place,
metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet
concealing all is that it is rich in figures. Metaphor is an enigma, wherein
the thief who is plotting a stroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape,
take refuge. No idiom is more metaphorical than slang devisser le coco to unscrew
the nut, to twist the neck tortiller to wriggle, to eat etre gerbe, to be tried
a rat, a bread thief il lansquine, it rains, a striking, ancient figure which
partly bears its date about it, which assimilates long oblique lines of rain,
with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a
single word the popular expression it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion
as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass from the
primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense. The devil ceases to be le
rabouin, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1667 and becomes le boulanger the
baker, who puts the bread into the oven. This is more witty, but less grand,
something like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides after AEschylus. Certain
slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric
character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories. Les
sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails a la lunethe prowlers are going to steal
horses by night, this passes before the mind like a group of spectres. One
knows not what one sees. In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the
language. It uses it in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard,
and it often confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and
summary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed and
complicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, in which
there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, the direct
creation and the metaphor le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin
trime dans le sabri, the dog is barking, I suspect that the diligence for Paris
is passing through the woods. Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussiere, la
fee est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the
daughter is pretty. Generally, to throw listeners off the track, slang confines
itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction, an
ignoble tail, a termination in aille, in orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus
Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of mutton
good? A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether
the sum offered for his escape suited him. 1668 Les Miserables The termination
in mar has been added recently. Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly
becomes corrupted itself. Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as
soon as it feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what
happens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls upon it
kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of decomposition
and recomposition an obscure and rapid work which never pauses. It passes over
more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries. Thus le larton bread
becomes le lartif le gail horse becomes le gaye la fertanche straw becomes la
fertille le momignard brat, le momacque les fiques duds, frusques la chique the
church, legrugeoir le colabre neck, le colas. The devil is at first, gahisto,
then le rabouin, then the baker the priest is a ratichon, then the boar le
sanglier the dagger is le vingt-deux twenty-two, then le surin, then le lingre
the police are railles, then roussins, then rousses, then marchands de lacets
dealers in stay-laces, then coquers, then cognes the executioner is le taule,
then Charlot, latigeur, then le becquillard. In the seventeenth century, to
fight was to give each other snuff in the nineteenth it is to chew each others throats.
There have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes. Cartouches
talk would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of this language are
perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter them. Still, from time to
time, and in consequence of this very movement, the ancient slang crops up
again and becomes new once more. It has its headquarters where it maintains
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1669 its sway. The Temple preserved the slang
of the seventeenth century Bicetre, when it was a prison, preserved the slang
of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in anche of the old Thuneurs.
Boyanches-tu bois-tu, do you drink? But perpetual movement remains its law,
nevertheless. If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes
of observation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, he falls into
doleful and useful meditation. No study is more efficacious and more fecund in
instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, in slang, which does not
contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat means to feign one beats a malady
ruse is their strength. For them, the idea of the man is not separated from the
idea of darkness. The night is called la sorgue man, lorgue. Man is a
derivative of the night. They have taken up the practice of considering society
in the light of an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they
speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is
a sick man one who is condemned is a dead man. The most terrible thing for the
prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried, is a sort of glacial
chastity, and he calls the dungeon the castus. In that funereal place, life
outside always presents itself under its most smiling aspect. The prisoner has irons
on his feet you think, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet
that one walks? No he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so,
when he has succeeded in severing his fetters, his first idea is that now he
can dance, and he calls the saw the bas- 1670 Les Miserables tringue
public-house ball.A name is a centre profound assimilation.The ruffian has two
heads, one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long,
and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death he calls
the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne, and the head which expiates
it la tronche.When a man has no longer anything but rags upon his body and
vices in his heart, when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation
which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations, he is ripe for
crime he is like a well-whetted knife he has two cutting edges, his distress
and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard, it says un reguise.What are
the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. The convict calls himself a fagot.
And finally, what name do malefactors give to their prison? The college. A
whole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word. Does the reader wish
to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys, those refrains called
in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, have had their birth? Let him listen to
what follows There existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large and long cellar.
This cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows
nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door men could enter there, air could
not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and for floor ten inches of
mud. It was flagged but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of
the water. Eight feet above the floor, a long and massive beam traversed this
subterranean excavation from side to side from this beam hung, at short
distances Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1671 apart, chains three feet long,
and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck. In this vault,
men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of
their departure for Toulon. They were thrust under this beam, where each one
found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him. The chains,
those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands, caught the unhappy
wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left there. As the chain was too
short, they could not lie down. They remained motionless in that cavern, in
that night, beneath that beam, almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to
reach their bread, jug, or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth
flowing to their very calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and
knees giving way, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to
obtain some rest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened
every moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more. In order to
eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along their leg
with their heel until it reached their hand. How long did they remain thus? One
month, two months, six months sometimes one stayed a year. It was the
antechamber of the galleys. Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king.
In this sepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they
went through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they sang for
song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters of Malta, when a
galley was approaching, the song could be heard before the sound of the oars.
Poor Survin- 1672 Les Miserables cent, the poacher, who had gone through the
prison-cellar of the Chatelet, said It was the rhymes that kept me up.
Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme? It is in this cellar that
nearly all the slang songs had their birth. It is from the dungeon of the
Grand-Chatelet of Paris that comes the melancholy refrain of the Montgomery
galley Timaloumisaine, timaloumison. The majority of these Icicaille est la theatre
Here is the theatre Du petit dardant. Of the little archer Cupid. Do what you
will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart of man, love. In
this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret is the thing
above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches, is unity which
serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is to tear from each member of
this fierce community something of his own personality. To inform against, in
the energetic slang dialect, is called to eat the bit. As though the informer
drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit
of each ones flesh. What does it signify to receive a box on the ear?
Commonplace metaphor replies It is to see thirty-six candles. Here slang
intervenes and takes it up Candle, camoufle. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue
gives camouflet42 as the synonym for soufflet. Thus, by a sort of infiltration
from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1673 trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the Academy
and Poulailler saying I light my camoufle, causes Voltaire to write Langleviel
La Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets. 42 Smoke puffed in the face of a
person asleep. Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study and
investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of
intersection of regular society with society which is accursed. The thief also
has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I, whoever passes by le pantre.
Pan, everybody. Slang is language turned convict. That the thinking principle
of man be thrust down ever so low, that it can be dragged and pinioned there by
obscure tyrannies of fatality, that it can be bound by no one knows what
fetters in that abyss, is sufficient to create consternation. Oh, poor thought
of miserable wretches! Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul
in that darkness? Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the
liberator, the immense rider of Pegasi and hippo-griffs, the combatant of
heroes of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, the
radiant knight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance
the lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned to hear the fearful approach
of Evil through the density of the gulf, and to catch glimpses, nearer and
nearer at hand, beneath the hideous water of that dragons head, that maw
streaked with foam, and that writhing undulation 1674 Les Miserables of claws,
swellings, and rings? Must it remain there, without a gleam of light, without
hope, given over to that terrible approach, vaguely scented out by the monster,
shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms, forever chained to the rock of
night, a sombre Andromeda white and naked amid the shadows! Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1675 CHAPTER III SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS As
the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred years ago,
like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre, symbolical spirit
which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful, now menacing. One feels
in it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the Court of Miracles
who played at cards with packs of their own, some of which have come down to
us. The eight of clubs, for instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight
enormous trefoil leaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At
the foot of this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting
a huntsman on a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot,
whence emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than these
reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes for the
roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters.
The diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, even
raillery, even menace, all partook of this powerless and 1676 Les Miserables
dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of some of which have been
collected, were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears. The pegre
is always the poor pegre, and he is always the hare in hiding, the fugitive
mouse, the flying bird. He hardly complains, he contents himself with sighing
one of his moans has come down to us I do not understand how God, the father of
men, can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry, without
himself suffering torture.43 The wretch, whenever he has time to think, makes
himself small before the low, and frail in the presence of society he lies down
flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to the side of compassion we feel
that he is conscious of his guilt. 43 Je nentrave que le dail comment meck, le
daron des orgues, peut atiger ses momes et ses momignards et les locher criblant
sans etre agite lui-meme. Towards the middle of the last century a change took
place, prison songs and thieves ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent
and jovial mien. The plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla. We find in
the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons, a
diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident and lilting refrain
which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam, and which
seems to have been flung into the forest by a will-o-the-wisp playing the fife
Miralabi suslababo Mirliton ribonribette Surlababi mirlababo Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1677 Mirliton ribonribo. This was sung in a cellar or in a
nook of the forest while cutting a mans throat. A serious symptom. In the
eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy of the dejected classes vanishes.
They began to laugh. They rally the grand meg and the grand dab. Given Louis
XV. they call the King of France le Marquis de Pantin. And behold, they are
almost gay. A sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches, as though
their consciences were not heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes
of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions, they
possess the heedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense of
their criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers, some
indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of. A sign that theft
and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way
as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, while communicating much of it to
sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, of some outbreak which is prodigious
and near unless some diversion shall arise. Let us pause a moment. Whom are we
accusing here? Is it the eighteenth century? Is it philosophy? Certainly not.
The work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome. The
encyclopedists, Diderot at their head the physiocrates, Turgot at their head
the philosophers, Voltaire at their head the Utopians, Rousseau at their
head,these are four sacred legions. Humanitys immense 1678 Les Miserables
advance towards the light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of the
human race, marching towards the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot
towards the beautiful, Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true,
Rousseau towards the just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, there
were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth, hemlock
in the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the great books of the
liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers
now forgotten were publishing, with the Kings sanction, no one knows what
strangely disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the unfortunate.
Some of these publications, odd to say, which were patronized by a prince, are
to be found in the Secret Library. These facts, significant but unknown, were
imperceptible on the surface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks
its danger. It is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the
one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was
Restif de La Bretonne. This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more
ravages in Germany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period,
summed up by Schiller in his famous drama The Robbers, theft and pillage rose
up in protest against property and labor, assimilated certain specious and
false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance, were absurd in
reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them, after a
fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state of theory, and in that
shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, and honest Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1679 masses, unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had
prepared the mixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a
fact of this sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenders wrath
and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep, which is the
same thing as shutting ones eyes, the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights
its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreams in a corner, and
sets itself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible
thing. Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearful
commotions which were formerly called jacqueries, beside which purely political
agitations are the merest childs play, which are no longer the conflict of the
oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt of discomfort against comfort. Then
everything crumbles. Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people. It is this
peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth century, which the
French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cut short. The French
Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed with the sword, rose
erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed the door of ill and opened
the door of good. It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled
miasma, rendered the century healthy, crowned the populace. It may be said of
it that it created man a second time, by giving him a second soul, the right.
The nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its 1680 Les Miserables
work, and to-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply
impossible. Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he who fears it!
Revolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie. Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions
have changed. Feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. There
is no more of the Middle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the
days when terrible swarms within made irruptions, when one heard beneath his
feet the obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations from
mole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where the soil
cracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one suddenly beheld
monstrous heads emerging from the earth. The revolutionary sense is a moral
sense. The sentiment of right, once developed, develops the sentiment of duty.
The law of all is liberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins,
according to Robespierres admirable definition. Since 89, the whole people has
been dilating into a sublime individual there is not a poor man, who,
possessing his right, has not his ray of sun the die-of-hunger feels within him
the honesty of France the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor he who is
free is scrupulous he who votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility hence the
miscarriage of unhealthy lusts hence eyes heroically lowered before
temptations. The revolutionary wholesomeness is such, that on a day of
deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is no longer any populace.
The first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is death to thieves!
Progress is an Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1681 honest man the ideal and
the absolute do not filch pockethandkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons
containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over the treasure. Virtue
rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. In those wagons in chests, hardly
closed, and some, even, half-open, amid a hundred dazzling caskets, was that
ancient crown of France, studded with diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of
royalty, by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted,
they guarded that crown. Hence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of
the skilful. The old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter and
henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of
the red spectre is broken. Every one knows it now. The scare-crow scares no
longer. The birds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creatures alight upon
it, the bourgeois laugh at it. 1682 Les Miserables CHAPTER IV THE TWO DUTIES TO
WATCH AND TO HOPE This being the case, is all social danger dispelled?
Certainly not. There is no Jacquerie society may rest assured on that point
blood will no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the manner
in which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisis is
there. Social phthisis is called misery. One can perish from being undermined
as well as from being struck by lightning. Let us not weary of repeating, and
sympathetic souls must not forget that this is the first of fraternal
obligations, and selfish hearts must understand that the first of political
necessities consists in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing
throngs, in solacing, airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their
horizon to a magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every
form, in offering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness, in
diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the universal aim,
in setting a limit to poverty Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1683 without
setting a limit to wealth, in creating vast fields of public and popular
activity, in having, like Briareus, a hundred hands to extend in all directions
to the oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective power for that
grand duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes, and
laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting salaries,
diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is, that is to say, in
proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need in a word, in evolving
from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for the benefit of those
who suffer and those who are ignorant. And, let us say it, all this is but the
beginning. The true question is this labor cannot be a law without being a
right. We will not insist upon this point this is not the proper place for
that. If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight.
Intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material
improvement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity, truth is
nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from science and wisdom
grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do
not eat. If there is anything more heartbreaking than a body perishing for lack
of bread, it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light. The whole of
progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day we shall be amazed. As
the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of
1684 Les Miserables distress. The obliteration of misery will be accomplished
by a simple elevation of level. We should do wrong were we to doubt this
blessed consummation. The past is very strong, it is true, at the present
moment. It censures. This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is
walking and advancing. It seems a victor this dead body is a conqueror. He
arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with his
banner, ignorance a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, he threatens,
he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on our side. Let us sell the
field on which Hannibal is encamped. What have we to fear, we who believe? No
such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists a return
of a river on its course. But let those who do not desire a future reflect on
this matter. When they say no to progress, it is not the future but themselves
that they are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady they are
inoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting
To-morrow, and that is to die. Now, no death, that of the body as late as
possible, that of the soul never,this is what we desire. Yes, the enigma will
utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problem will be solved. Yes, the
people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be finished by the
nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future blossoming, the near
blossoming forth of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1685 universal well-being,
is a divinely fatal phenomenon. Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs
and conduct them within a given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a
state of equilibrium that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth and
heaven results from humanity and governs it this force is a worker of miracles
marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes.
Aided by science, which comes from one man, and by the event, which comes from
another, it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude of
problems, which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful
at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a
lesson from the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from that
mysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident face to
face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the imaums converse
with Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid. In the meantime, let there
be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in the grandiose onward march of minds.
Social philosophy consists essentially in science and peace. Its object is, and
its result must be, to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines,
it scrutinizes, it analyzes then it puts together once more, it proceeds by
means of reduction, discarding all hatred. More than once, a society has been
seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind history is
full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires manners, customs, laws,
religions,and some fine day that unknown force, the 1686 Les Miserables
hurricane, passes by and bears them all away. The civilizations of India, of
Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, of Egypt, have disappeared one after the other.
Why? We know not. What are the causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could
these societies have been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the
fatal vice which destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these
terrible deaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no
reply. Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then they
sank. We have nothing more to say and it is with a sort of terror that we look
on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind those colossal
waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus,
Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the
shadows. But shadows are there, and light is here. We are not acquainted with
the maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of
our own. Everywhere upon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its
beauties, we lay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe and the sickness
once diagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy.
Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and its prodigy it
is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It is already much to have
solaced it its enlightenment is yet another point. All the labors of modern
social philosophies must converge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has
a great duty to auscultate civilization. We repeat, that this auscultation
brings encouragement it is by this persistence in encouragement that we wish to
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1687 conclude these pages, an austere interlude
in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, we feel human
imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it has these wounds,
craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, nor because of a volcano
which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people do not kill man. And yet, any
one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his head at times. The
strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have their hours of weakness. Will
the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put this question, when
we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholy face-to-face encounter of
selfish and wretched. On the part of the selfish, the prejudices, shadows of
costly education, appetite increasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity
which dulls, a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for
the suffering, an implacable satisfaction, the I so swollen that it bars the
soul on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others
enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires,
hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure and simple ignorance.
Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous point which we
distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal is frightful to behold,
thus lost in the depths, small, isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, but
surrounded by those great, black menaces, monstrously heaped around it yet no
more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds. 1688 Les Miserables BOOK

CHAPTER I FULL LIGHT The reader has probably understood that Eponine, having
recognized through the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon
had sent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet, and
had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent in ecstasy
before that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the
magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom
he loves, had finally entered Cosettes garden as Romeo entered the garden of
Juliet. This had even proved easier for him than for Romeo Romeo was obliged to
scale a wall, Marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the
decrepit gate which vacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old
peoples teeth. Marius was slender and readily passed through. As there was
never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered the garden except at
night, he ran no risk of being seen. Beginning with that blessed and holy hour
when a kiss betrothed these two souls, Marius was there every eve- 1690 Les
Miserables ning. If, at that period of her existence, Cosette had fallen in
love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched, she would have been
lost for there are generous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one
of them. One of womans magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it
is absolute, is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of
modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give the heart, and
we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze upon it in the gloom
with a shudder. Love has no middle course it either ruins or it saves. All
human destiny lies in this dilemma. This dilemma, ruin, or safety, is set forth
no more inexorably by any fatality than by love. Love is life, if it is not
death. Cradle also coffin. The same sentiment says yes and no in the human
heart. Of all the things that God has made, the human heart is the one which
sheds the most light, alas! and the most darkness. God willed that Cosettes
love should encounter one of the loves which save. Throughout the whole of the
month of May of that year 1832, there were there, in every night, in that poor,
neglected garden, beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day
by day, two beings composed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with
all the felicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure,
honest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the shadows. It
seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, and to Marius that Cosette had a
nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each other, they clasped each
others hands, they Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1691 pressed close to each
other but there was a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected
it they did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier,
Cosettes innocence and Cosette of a support, Marius loyalty. The first kiss had
also been the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone further than to touch
Cosettes hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of her hair, with his lips. For him,
Cosette was a perfume and not a woman. He inhaled her. She refused nothing, and
he asked nothing. Cosette was happy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived in
this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by
another soul. It was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the
ideal. Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau. At that hour of love, an hour when
voluptuousness is absolutely mute, beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius,
the pure and seraphic Marius, would rather have gone to a woman of the town
than have raised Cosettes robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the
moonlight, Cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell
apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius turned
away his eyes. What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored
each other. At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a
sacred spot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they
opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton and vigorous
vegetation quivered, full of strength and intoxication, around these two
innocents, and they uttered words of love 1692 Les Miserables which set the
trees to trembling. What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths
sufficed to trouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which we
should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these
conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths
by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of two lovers that
melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies them like a lyre, and
what remains is nothing more than a shade you say What! is that all! eh! yes,
childish prattle, repetitions, laughter at nothing, nonsense, everything that is
deepest and most sublime in the world! The only things which are worth the
trouble of saying and hearing! The man who has never heard, the man who has
never uttered these absurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a
malicious fellow. Cosette said to Marius Dost thou know? In all this and
athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without either of them being able to
say how it had come about, they had begun to call each other thou. Dost thou
know? My name is Euphrasie. Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette. Oh!
Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I was a little thing. But
my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like that nameEuphrasie? Yes. But Cosette
is not ugly. Do you like it better than Euphrasie? Why, yes. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1693 Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call me
Cosette. And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a
grove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at him and
exclaimed Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, you
are not at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bid you
defiance with this word I love you! And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he
heard a strain sung by a star. Or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he
coughed, and she said to him Dont cough, sir I will not have people cough on my
domain without my permission. Its very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I
want you to be well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I
should be very unhappy. What should I do then? And this was simply divine. Once
Marius said to Cosette Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was
Ursule. This made both of them laugh the whole evening. In the middle of
another conversation, he chanced to exclaim Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I
had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran! But he stopped short, and went
no further. He would have been obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and
that was impossible. This bordered on a 1694 Les Miserables strange theme, the
flesh, before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of
sacred fright. Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without
anything else to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old and
accommodating bar of the chief-justices gate, to sit elbow to elbow on that
bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the on-coming night,
to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the ample fall of Cosettes gown,
to caress her thumb-nail, to call her thou, to smell of the same flower, one
after the other, forever, indefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above
their heads. Every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams
of men than of the clouds of heaven. This chaste, almost shy love was not
devoid of gallantry, by any means. To pay compliments to the woman whom a man
loves is the first method of bestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who
tries it. A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness
mingles there with its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws
back before voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius blandishments, all
saturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when they fly
up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such words. There were
mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all the positiveness of which
Marius was capable. It was what is said in the bower, a prelude to what will be
said in the chamber a lyrical effusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled,
pleasing hyperboles of cooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a
bouquet and exhaling a celestial Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1695 perfume,
an ineffable twitter of heart to heart. Oh! murmured Marius, how beautiful you
are! I dare not look at you. It is all over with me when I contemplate you. You
are a grace. I know not what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when
the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted
gleam when you open your thought even but a little! You talk astonishingly good
sense. It seems to me at times that you are a dream. Speak, I listen, I admire.
Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how charming! I am really beside myself. You
are adorable, Mademoiselle. I study your feet with the microscope and your soul
with the telescope. And Cosette answered I have been loving a little more all
the time that has passed since this morning. Questions and replies took care of
themselves in this dialogue, which always turned with mutual consent upon love,
as the little pith figures always turn on their peg. Cosettes whole person was
ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency, whiteness, candor, radiance. It might
have been said of Cosette that she was clear. She produced on those who saw her
the sensation of April and dawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a
condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman. It was quite simple
that Marius should admire her, since he adored her. But the truth is, that this
little school-girl, fresh from the convent, talked with exquisite penetration
and uttered, at times, all sorts of true and delicate sayings. Her prattle was
conversation. She never made a mistake 1696 Les Miserables about anything, and
she saw things justly. The woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of
the heart, which is infallible. No one understands so well as a woman, how to
say things that are, at once, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they
are the whole of woman in them lies the whole of heaven. In this full felicity,
tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A crushed lady-bug, a feather
fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn broken, aroused their pity, and their
ecstasy, sweetly mingled with melancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to
weep. The most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times,
almost unbearable. And, in addition to this,all these contradictions are the
lightning play of love,they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and
with a delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the
air of two boys. Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity,
nature is always present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her
brutal and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls, one
feels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysterious shade
which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends. They idolized each
other. The permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile,
they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, they
interlace their fingers, they call each other thou, and that does not prevent
eternity. Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twi- Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1697 light, in the invisible, with the birds, with the roses
they fascinate each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw
into their eyes, they murmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations
of the planets fill the infinite universe. 1698 Les Miserables CHAPTER II THE
BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS They existed vaguely, frightened at their
happiness. They did not notice the cholera which decimated Paris precisely
during that very month. They had confided in each other as far as possible, but
this had not extended much further than their names. Marius had told Cosette
that he was an orphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a
lawyer, that he lived by writing things for publishers, that his father had
been a colonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on
bad terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being a
baron, but this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did not know the meaning
of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, she had confided to him that she
had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that her mother, like his own,
was dead, that her fathers name was M. Fauchelevent, that he was very good,
that he gave a great deal to the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that
he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1699 Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had
lived since he had been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most
recent past, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette told
him satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell her about
the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier, about the burn, and
about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father. Marius had
momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not even know that there
had been a morning, what he had done, where he had breakfasted, nor who had
spoken to him he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other
thought he only existed at the hours when he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in
heaven, it was quite natural that he should forget earth. Both bore languidly
the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists
who are called lovers. Alas! Who is there who has not felt all these things?
Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life
go on afterwards? Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent
forgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will. There is
no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect
geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette and Marius nothing
existed except Marius and Cosette. The universe around them had fallen into a
hole. They lived in a golden minute. There was nothing before them, nothing
behind. It hardly occurred to Marius that Cosette had a father. His brain was
dazzled and obliterated. Of what did these lovers talk then? 1700 Les
Miserables We have seen, of the flowers, and the swallows, the setting sun and
the rising moon, and all sorts of important things. They had told each other
everything except everything. The everything of lovers is nothing. But the
father, the realities, that lair, the ruffians, that adventure, to what
purpose? And was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed? They
were two, and they adored each other, and beyond that there was nothing.
Nothing else existed. It is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is
inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are there any? Have
we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer know. A rosy cloud hangs over it.
So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all that
improbability which is in nature neither at the nadir nor at the zenith,
between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in the clouds hardly
flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot already too sublime to walk
the earth, still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue,
suspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the
bounds of destiny ignorant of that rut yesterday, to-day, to-morrow amazed,
rapturous, floating, soaring at times so light that they could take their
flight out into the infinite almost prepared to soar away to all eternity. They
slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of the real
overwhelmed by the ideal. Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his
eyes in her presence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1701 Marius and Cosette never asked themselves
whither this was to lead them. They considered that they had already arrived.
It is a strange claim on mans part to wish that love should lead to something.
1702 Les Miserables CHAPTER III THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW Jean Valjean suspected
nothing. Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that sufficed
for Jean Valjeans happiness. The thoughts which Cosette cherished, her tender
preoccupations, Marius image which filled her heart, took away nothing from the
incomparable purity of her beautiful, chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the
age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was
at ease. And then, when two lovers have come to an understanding, things always
go well the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of
perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the
same in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of Jean
Valjeans proposals. Did she want to take a walk? Yes, dear little father. Did
she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass the evening with
Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at ten oclock, Marius did
not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour, when, from Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1703 the street, he heard Cosette open the long
glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in the daytime.
Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was in existence. Only
once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette Why, you have whitewash on your
back! On the previous evening, Marius, in a transport, had pushed Cosette
against the wall. Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her
sleep, and was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean. Marius never
set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid themselves in a
recess near the steps, in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from
the street, and there they sat, frequently contenting themselves, by way of
conversation, with pressing each others hands twenty times a minute as they
gazed at the branches of the trees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have
fallen thirty paces from them, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply
was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other. Limpid
purity. Hours wholly white almost all alike. This sort of love is a
recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove. The whole extent of
the garden lay between them and the street. Every time that Marius entered and
left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the gate in such a manner that no
displacement was visible. He usually went away about midnight, and returned to
Courfeyracs lodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel 1704 Les Miserables Would you
believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one oclock in the morning. Bahorel
replied What do you expect? Theres always a petard in a seminary fellow. At
times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said to Marius
You are getting irregular in your habits, young man. Courfeyrac, being a
practical man, did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible
paradise upon Marius he was not much in the habit of concealed passions it made
him impatient, and now and then he called upon Marius to come back to reality.
One morning, he threw him this admonition My dear fellow, you produce upon me
the effect of being located in the moon, the realm of dreams, the province of
illusions, capital, soap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, whats her name? But
nothing could induce Marius to talk. They might have torn out his nails before
one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name, Cosette, was
composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb. Only,
Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that his taciturnity was of the beaming
order. During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know these
immense delights. To dispute and to say you for thou, simply that they might
say thou the better afterwards. To talk at great length with very minute
details, of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1705 world another proof that in that ravishing
opera called love, the libretto counts for almost nothing For Marius, to listen
to Cosette discussing finery For Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics
To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue de
Babylone To gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm
gleaming in the grass To hold their peace together a still greater delight than
conversation Etc., etc. In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.
One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the Boulevard
des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As he was on the point
of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some one quite close to him
say Good evening, Monsieur Marius. He raised his head and recognized Eponine.
This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that girl a
single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue Plumet, he had
not seen her again, and she had gone completely out of his mind. He had no
reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he owed her his happiness, and
yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet her. It is an error to think that
passion, when it is pure and happy, leads man to a state of perfection it
simply leads him, as we have noted, to a state of oblivion. In this situation,
man 1706 Les Miserables forgets to be bad, but he also forgets to be good.
Gratitude, duty, matters essential and important to be remembered, vanish. At
any other time, Marius would have behaved quite differently to Eponine.
Absorbed in Cosette, he had not even clearly put it to himself that this
Eponine was named Eponine Thenardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in
his fathers will, that name, for which, but a few months before, he would have
so ardently sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father himself
was fading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love. He
replied with some embarrassment Ah! so its you, Eponine? Why do you call me
you? Have I done anything to you? No, he answered. Certainly, he had nothing
against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that he could not do otherwise, now
that he used thou to Cosette, than say you to Eponine. As he remained silent,
she exclaimed Say Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that
creature formerly so heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not.
Then she resumed Well? Then she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.
Good evening, Mr. Marius, said she suddenly and abruptly and away she went.

IN SLANG The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is
necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung
on the horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at
nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening, with the
same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight of Eponine
approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days in succession this
was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard, changed his
course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur. This caused Eponine
to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which she had not yet done. Up to that
time, she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the
boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him. It was only on the evening
before that she had attempted to address him. So Eponine followed him, without
his suspecting the fact. She saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden.
1708 Les Miserables She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the
other, and readily recognized the one which Marius had moved. She murmured in a
low voice and in gloomy accents None of that, Lisette! She seated herself on
the underpinning of the railing, close beside the bar, as though she were
guarding it. It was precisely at the point where the railing touched the
neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, in which Eponine was entirely
concealed. She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and
without breathing, a prey to her thoughts. Towards ten oclock in the evening,
one of the two or three persons who passed through the Rue Plumet, an old,
belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of
evil repute, as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it
made with the wall, heard a dull and threatening voice saying Im no longer
surprised that he comes here every evening. The passer-by cast a glance around
him, saw no one, dared not peer into the black niche, and was greatly alarmed.
He redoubled his pace. This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few
instants later, six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from
each other, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,
entered the Rue Plumet. The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and
waited Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1709 for the others a second later, all
six were reunited. These men began to talk in a low voice. This is the place,
said one of them. Is there a cab dog in the garden? asked another. I dont know.
In any case, I have fetched a ball that well make him eat. Have you some putty
to break the pane with? Yes. The railing is old, interpolated a fifth, who had
the voice of a ventriloquist. So much the better, said the second who had
spoken. It wont screech under the saw, and it wont be hard to cut. The sixth,
who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the gate, as Eponine had
done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in succession, and shaking them
cautiously. Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the
point of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness, fell
upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of
his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not loudly Theres a dog. At the
same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him. The man underwent
that shock which the unexpected always brings. He bristled up in hideous wise
nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy their
terrified air evokes terror. He recoiled and stammered What jade is this? 1710
Les Miserables Your daughter. It was, in fact, Eponine, who had addressed
Thenardier. At the apparition of Eponine, the other five, that is to say,
Claquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn
near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the sinister
slowness peculiar to these men of the night. Some indescribable but hideous
tools were visible in their hands. Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved
pincers which prowlers call fanchons. Ah, see here, what are you about there?
What do you want with us? Are you crazy? exclaimed Thenardier, as loudly as one
can exclaim and still speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for?
Eponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck. I am here, little
father, because I am here. Isnt a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays?
Its you who ought not to be here. What have you come here for, since its a
biscuit? I told Magnon so. Theres nothing to be done here. But embrace me, my
good little father! Its a long time since Ive seen you! So youre out?
Thenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponines arms, and grumbled Thats
good. Youve embraced me. Yes, Im out. Im not in. Now, get away with you. But
Eponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses. But how did you
manage it, little pa? You must have Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1711 been
very clever to get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is
mother? Tell me about mamma. Thenardier replied Shes well. I dont know, let me
alone, and be off, I tell you. I wont go, so there now, pouted Eponine like a
spoiled child you send me off, and its four months since I saw you, and Ive
hardly had time to kiss you. And she caught her father round the neck again.
Come, now, this is stupid! said Babet. Make haste! said Guelemer, the cops may
pass. The ventriloquists voice repeated his distich Nous n sommes pas le jour
de lan, This isnt New Years day A becoter papa, maman. To peck at pa and ma.
Eponine turned to the five ruffians. Why, its Monsieur Brujon. Good day,
Monsieur Babet. Good day, Monsieur Claquesous. Dont you know me, Monsieur
Guelemer? How goes it, Montparnasse? Yes, they know you! ejaculated Thenardier.
But good day, good evening, sheer off! leave us alone! Its the hour for foxes,
not for chickens, said Montparnasse. You see the job we have on hand here,
added Babet. Eponine caught Montparnasses hand. Take care, said he, youll cut
yourself, Ive a knife open. My little Montparnasse, responded Eponine very
gently, you must have confidence in people. I am the daughter of my father,
perhaps. Monsieur Babet, Monsieur Guelemer, 1712 Les Miserables Im the person
who was charged to investigate this matter. It is remarkable that Eponine did
not talk slang. That frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she
had known Marius. She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a
skeleton, Guelemers huge, coarse fingers, and continued You know well that Im
no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have rendered you service on various
occasions. Well, I have made inquiries you will expose yourselves to no
purpose, you see. I swear to you that there is nothing in this house. There are
lone women, said Guelemer. No, the persons have moved away. The candles havent,
anyway! ejaculated Babet. And he pointed out to Eponine, across the tops of the
trees, a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion.
It was Toussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry. Eponine
made a final effort. Well, said she, theyre very poor folks, and its a hovel
where there isnt a sou. Go to the devil! cried Thenardier. When weve turned the
house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, well tell
you what there is inside, and whether its francs or sous or half-farthings. And
he pushed her aside with the intention of entering. My good friend, Mr.
Montparnasse, said Eponine, I entreat you, you are a good fellow, dont enter.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1713 Take care, youll cut yourself, replied Montparnasse.
Thenardier resumed in his decided tone Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their
own affairs! Eponine released Montparnasses hand, which she had grasped again,
and said So you mean to enter this house? Rather! grinned the ventriloquist.
Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were armed
to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons, and said in a
firm, low voice Well, I dont mean that you shall. They halted in amazement. The
ventriloquist, however, finished his grin. She went on Friends! Listen well.
This is not what you want. Now Im talking. In the first place, if you enter
this garden, if you lay a hand on this gate, Ill scream, Ill beat on the door,
Ill rouse everybody, Ill have the whole six of you seized, Ill call the police.
Shed do it, too, said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon and the ventriloquist.
She shook her head and added Beginning with my father! Thenardier stepped
nearer. Not so close, my good man! said she. He retreated, growling between his
teeth Why, whats the matter with her? And he added Bitch! She began to laugh in
a terrible way 1714 Les Miserables As you like, but you shall not enter here.
Im not the daughter of a dog, since Im the daughter of a wolf. There are six of
you, what matters that to me? You are men. Well, Im a woman. You dont frighten
me. I tell you that you shant enter this house, because it doesnt suit me. If
you approach, Ill bark. I told you, Im the dog, and I dont care a straw for
you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, but dont come here, I
forbid it! You can use your knives. Ill use kicks its all the same to me, come
on! She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst out
laughing Pardine! Im not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall be
cold this winter. Arent they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to think they
can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you have finical poppets
of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice, forsooth! I
aint afraid of anything, that I aint! She fastened her intent gaze upon
Thenardier and said Not even of you, father! Then she continued, as she cast
her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon the ruffians in turn What do I care if
Im picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of the Rue Plumet, killed by the
blows of my fathers club, or whether Im found a year from now in the nets at
Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned
dogs? She was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough, her breath came
from her weak and narrow chest like the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1715
death-rattle. She resumed I have only to cry out, and people will come, and
then slap, bang! There are six of you I represent the whole world. Thenardier made
a movement towards her. Dont approach! she cried. He halted, and said gently
Well, no I wont approach, but dont speak so loud. So you intend to hinder us in
our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the same. Have you no
longer any kind feeling for your father? You bother me, said Eponine. But we
must live, we must eat Burst! So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning
of the fence and hummed Mon bras si dodu, My arm so plump, Ma jambe bien faite
My leg well formed, Et le temps perdu. And time wasted. She had set her elbow
on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she swung her foot with an air of
indifference. Her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulderblades.
The neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude.
Nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen. The six rascals,
speechless and gloomy at being held in 1716 Les Miserables check by a girl,
retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel with furious
and humiliated shrugs. In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but
peaceful air. Theres something the matter with her, said Babet. A reason. Is
she in love with the dog? Its a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an old
fellow who lodges in the backyard, and curtains that aint so bad at the
windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the jobs a good one. Well, go in,
then, the rest of you, exclaimed Montparnasse. Do the job. Ill stay here with
the girl, and if she fails us He flashed the knife, which he held open in his
hand, in the light of the lantern. Thenardier said not a word, and seemed ready
for whatever the rest pleased. Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who
had, as the reader knows, put up the job, had not as yet spoken. He seemed
thoughtful. He had the reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known
that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this he made
verses and songs, which gave him great authority. Babet interrogated him You
say nothing, Brujon? Brujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook
his head in various ways, and finally concluded to speak See here this morning
I came across two sparrows fighting, this evening I jostled a woman who was
quarrelling. All thats bad. Lets quit. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1717
They went away. As they went, Montparnasse muttered Never mind! if they had
wanted, Id have cut her throat. Babet responded I wouldnt. I dont hit a lady.
At the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following enigmatical
dialogue in a low tone Where shall we go to sleep to-night? Under Pantin Paris.
Have you the key to the gate, Thenardier? Pardi. Eponine, who never took her
eyes off of them, saw them retreat by the road by which they had come. She rose
and began to creep after them along the walls and the houses. She followed them
thus as far as the boulevard. There they parted, and she saw these six men
plunge into the gloom, where they appeared to melt away. 1718 Les Miserables
CHAPTER V THINGS OF THE NIGHT After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue
Plumet resumed its tranquil, nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place
in this street would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,
the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in a sombre
manner the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the
invisible that which is below man distinguishes, through the mists, that which
is beyond man and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet
face to face in the night. Nature, bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain
approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of
the gloom know each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and
claws fear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious
appetites, hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws
which have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out uneasily the
impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, erect in its vague and
shuddering robe, and which seem to them to live with a dead and terrible life.
These brutalities, which are only Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1719 matter,
entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity
condensed into an unknown being. A black figure barring the way stops the wild
beast short. That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts
that which emerges from the cave the ferocious fear the sinister wolves recoil
when they encounter a ghoul. 1720 Les Miserables CHAPTER VI MARIUS BECOMES
PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING COSETTE HIS ADDRESS While this sort
of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate, and while the six
ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was by Cosettes side. Never had the
sky been more studded with stars and more charming, the trees more trembling,
the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among
the leaves with a sweeter noise never had all the harmonies of universal
serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love never had Marius
been more captivated, more happy, more ecstatic. But he had found Cosette sad
Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes were red. This was the first cloud in that
wonderful dream. Marius first word had been What is the matter? Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1721 And she had replied This. Then she had seated herself on
the bench near the steps, and while he tremblingly took his place beside her,
she had continued My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness,
because he has business, and we may go away from here. Marius shivered from
head to foot. When one is at the end of ones life, to die means to go away when
one is at the beginning of it, to go away means to die. For the last six weeks,
Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees, taken possession of Cosette
each day. As we have already explained, in the case of first love, the soul is
taken long before the body later on, one takes the body long before the soul
sometimes one does not take the soul at all the Faublas and the Prudhommes add
Because there is none but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius
possessed Cosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her with all his soul,
and seized her jealously with incredible conviction. He possessed her smile,
her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the sweetness
of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark which she had on her
neck, all her thoughts. Therefore, he possessed all Cosettes dreams. He
incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath, the
short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to himself that there was
not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him, Marius. He 1722 Les
Miserables gazed upon and adored the things that she wore, her knot of ribbon,
her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her cuffs, as sacred objects of which he
was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs
which she wore in her hair, and he even said to himself, in confused and
suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the
light, that there was not a ribbon of her gown, not a mesh in her stockings,
not a fold in her bodice, which was not his. Beside Cosette he felt himself
beside his own property, his own thing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed
as though they had so intermingled their souls, that it would have been
impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again.This is
mine. No, it is mine. I assure you that you are mistaken. This is my property.
What you are taking as your own is myself. Marius was something that made a
part of Cosette, and Cosette was something which made a part of Marius. Marius
felt Cosette within him. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this, to him, was
not to be distinguished from breathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of
this intoxication, of this virgin possession, unprecedented and absolute, of
this sovereignty, that these words We are going away, fell suddenly, at a blow,
and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him Cosette is not yours! Marius
awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said, outside of life
those words, going away! caused him to re-enter it harshly. He found not a word
to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold. She said to him in her
turn What is Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1723 the matter? He replied in so
low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him I did not understand what you said.
She began again This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs
and to hold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in a
trunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away, that it
is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him, and that all
is to be ready in a week from now, and that we might go to England. But this is
outrageous! exclaimed Marius. It is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of
power, no violence, not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action
of Busiris, of Tiberius, or of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in
atrocity, in the opinion of Marius M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to
England because he had business there. He demanded in a weak voice And when do
you start? He did not say when. And when shall you return? He did not say when.
Marius rose and said coldly Cosette, shall you go? Cosette turned toward him
her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish, and replied in a sort of
bewilderment Where? 1724 Les Miserables To England. Shall you go? Why do you
say you to me? I ask you whether you will go? What do you expect me to do? she
said, clasping her hands. So, you will go? If my father goes. So, you will go?
Cosette took Marius hand, and pressed it without replying. Very well, said
Marius, then I will go elsewhere. Cosette felt rather than understood the
meaning of these words. She turned so pale that her face shone white through
the gloom. She stammered What do you mean? Marius looked at her, then raised his
eyes to heaven, and answered Nothing. When his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette
smiling at him. The smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible
radiance, even at night. How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea. What is it?
If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join me wherever
I am. Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into reality.
He cried to Cosette Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have
money, and I have none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I dont know
how much, more than ten Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1725 louis to
Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted! I have an old
hat which is not worth three francs, I have a coat which lacks buttons in
front, my shirt is all ragged, my elbows are torn, my boots let in the water
for the last six weeks I have not thought about it, and I have not told you
about it. You only see me at night, and you give me your love if you were to
see me in the daytime, you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I havent
enough to pay for a passport! He threw himself against a tree which was close
at hand, erect, his brow pressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood
which flayed his skin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and
there he stood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of despair.
He remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in such abysses. At
last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stifled noise, which was
sweet yet sad. It was Cosette sobbing. She had been weeping for more than two
hours beside Marius as he meditated. He came to her, fell at her knees, and
slowly prostrating himself, he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from
beneath her robe, and kissed it. She let him have his way in silence. There are
moments when a woman accepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion
of love. Do not weep, he said. She murmured Not when I may be going away, and
you cannot come! 1726 Les Miserables He went on Do you love me? She replied,
sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid
tears I adore you! He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress Do
not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep? Do you love me?
said she. He took her hand. Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any
one, because my word of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my
side. Well, I give you my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I
shall die. In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy
so solemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill which is
produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock made her cease
weeping. Now, listen, said he, do not expect me to-morrow. Why? Do not expect
me until the day after to-morrow. Oh! Why? You will see. A day without seeing
you! But that is impossible! Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our
whole lives, perhaps. And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1727 He is a man who never changes his habits, and
he has never received any one except in the evening. Of what man are you
speaking? asked Cosette. I? I said nothing. What do you hope, then? Wait until
the day after to-morrow. You wish it? Yes, Cosette. She took his head in both
her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him, and
tried to read his hope in his eyes. Marius resumed Now that I think of it, you
ought to know my address something might happen, one never knows I live with
that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue de la Verrerie, No. 16. He searched in his
pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of
the wall 16 Rue de la Verrerie. In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into
his eyes once more. Tell me your thought, Marius you have some idea. Tell it to
me. Oh! tell me, so that I may pass a pleasant night. This is my idea that it
is impossible that God should mean to part us. Wait expect me the day after
to-morrow. What shall I do until then? said Cosette. You are outside, you go,
and come! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad I shall
be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell me. I am going
to try something. 1728 Les Miserables Then I will pray to God and I will think
of you here, so that you may be successful. I will question you no further,
since you do not wish it. You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow
in singing that music from Euryanthe that you love, and that you came one
evening to listen to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you will
come early. I shall expect you at dusk, at nine oclock precisely, I warn you.
Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke of nine, do
you understand, I shall be in the garden. And I also. And without having
uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled by those electric currents
which place lovers in continual communication, both being intoxicated with
delight even in their sorrow, they fell into each others arms, without
perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes, overflowing with
rapture and full of tears, gazed upon the stars. When Marius went forth, the
street was deserted. This was the moment when Eponine was following the
ruffians to the boulevard. While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed
to the tree, an idea had crossed his mind an idea, alas! that he himself judged
to be senseless and impossible. He had come to a desperate decision. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1729 CHAPTER VII THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART
IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH OTHER At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past
his ninety-first birthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the
Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as
the reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await death
perfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom even sorrow
cannot curve. Still, his daughter had been saying for some time My father is
sinking. He no longer boxed the maids ears he no longer thumped the
landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in opening the
door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the space of barely six months.
He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that coupling of words, in the Moniteur M.
Humblot-Conte, peer of France. The fact is, that the old man was deeply
dejected. He did not bend, he did not yield this was no more a characteristic
1730 Les Miserables of his physical than of his moral nature, but he felt
himself giving way internally. For four years he had been waiting for Marius,
with his foot firmly planted, that is the exact word, in the conviction that
that good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other now
he had reached the point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself,
that if Marius made him wait much longerIt was not death that was insupportable
to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never see Marius again. The idea
of never seeing Marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the
thought began to recur to him, and it chilled him. Absence, as is always the
case in genuine and natural sentiments, had only served to augment the
grandfathers love for the ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It
is during December nights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks
oftenest of the son. M. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things,
incapable of taking a single step, hethe grandfather, towards his grandson I
would die rather, he said to himself. He did not consider himself as the least
to blame but he thought of Marius only with profound tenderness, and the mute
despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark. He
began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness. M. Gillenormand, without
however acknowledging it to himself, for it would have rendered him furious and
ashamed, had never loved a mistress as he loved Marius. He had had placed in his
chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that it should be the first thing on
which his Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1731 eyes fell on waking, an old
portrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, a portrait
which had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazed incessantly at that
portrait. One day, he happened to say, as he gazed upon it I think the likeness
is strong. To my sister? inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. Yes, certainly.
The old man added And to him also. Once as he sat with his knees pressed
together, and his eyes almost closed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter
ventured to say to him Father, are you as angry with him as ever? She paused,
not daring to proceed further. With whom? he demanded. With that poor Marius. He
raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table, and
exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone Poor Marius, do you say!
That gentleman is a knave, a wretched scoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a
heartless, soulless, haughty, and wicked man! And he turned away so that his
daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye. Three days later he
broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say to his daughter point-blank
I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him to me.
1732 Les Miserables Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced
this acute diagnosis My father never cared very much for my sister after her
folly. It is clear that he detests Marius. After her folly meant after she had
married the colonel. However, as the reader has been able to conjecture,
Mademoiselle Gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite,
the officer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Theodule, had not been a
success. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo. A vacancy in the
heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Theodule, on his side, though
he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the task of pleasing. The goodman
bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the goodman. Lieutenant Theodule was
gay, no doubt, but a chatter-box, frivolous, but vulgar a high liver, but a
frequenter of bad company he had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great
deal to say about them, it is true also but he talked badly. All his good
qualities had a defect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell
about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue
de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform,
with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him downright intolerable. Finally,
Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter Ive had enough of that Theodule. I
havent much taste for warriors in time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I
dont know but I prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of
blades in battle is less dismal, after all, than the Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1733 clank of the scabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing out
your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your
cuirass, is doubly ridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holds equally
aloof from swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer nor a
finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Theodule for yourself. It was in vain that his
daughter said to him But he is your grandnephew, nevertheless,it turned out
that M. Gillenormand, who was a grandfather to the very fingertips, was not in
the least a grand-uncle. In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared
the two, Theodule had only served to make him regret Marius all the more. One
evening,it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father Gillenormand
having a rousing fire on the hearth,he had dismissed his daughter, who was
sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone in his chamber, amid its
pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the andirons, half enveloped in his
huge screen of coromandel lacquer, with its nine leaves, with his elbow resting
on a table where burned two candles under a green shade, engulfed in his
tapestry armchair, and in his hand a book which he was not reading. He was
dressed, according to his wont, like an incroyable, and resembled an antique
portrait by Garat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had
not his daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishops wadded
cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a dressing gown,
except when he rose and retired. It gives one a look of age, said he. 1734 Les
Miserables Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly
and, as usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always ended
by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point where a man
tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart. He was
explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why Marius should
return, that if he intended to return, he should have done it long ago, that he
must renounce the idea. He was trying to accustom himself to the thought that
all was over, and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman
again. But his whole nature revolted his aged paternity would not consent to
this. Well! said he, this was his doleful refrain,he will not return! His bald
head had fallen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze
upon the ashes on his hearth. In the very midst of his revery, his old servant
Basque entered, and inquired Can Monsieur receive M. Marius? The old man sat up
erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic
shock. All his blood had retreated to his heart. He stammered M. Marius what? I
dont know, replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance by his
masters air I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said to me Theres a
young man here say that it is M. Marius. Father Gillenormand stammered in a low
voice Show him in. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1735 And he remained in the
same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes fixed on the door. It opened
once more. A young man entered. It was Marius. Marius halted at the door, as
though waiting to be bidden to enter. His almost squalid attire was not
perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade. Nothing could be seen but his
calm, grave, but strangely sad face. It was several minutes before Father
Gillenormand, dulled with amazement and joy, could see anything except a
brightness as when one is in the presence of an apparition. He was on the point
of swooning he saw Marius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it
certainly was Marius. At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him
entire, so to speak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome,
distinguished, well-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming
air. He felt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward
his heart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and overflowed his
breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips,
and, by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature, what came
forth was harshness. He said abruptly What have you come here for? Marius
replied with embarrassment Monsieur M. Gillenormand would have liked to have
Marius throw himself into his arms. He was displeased with Marius and with
himself. He was conscious that he was brusque, and 1736 Les Miserables that
Marius was cold. It caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to
feel so tender and forlorn within, and only to be able to be hard outside.
Bitterness returned. He interrupted Marius in a peevish tone Then why did you
come? That then signified If you do not come to embrace me. Marius looked at
his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble. Monsieur Have you come
to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults? He thought he was putting Marius
on the right road, and that the child would yield. Marius shivered it was the
denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied
No, sir. Then, exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was
poignant and full of wrath, what do you want of me? Marius clasped his hands,
advanced a step, and said in a feeble and trembling voice Sir, have pity on me.
These words touched M. Gillenormand uttered a little sooner, they would have
rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose he supported
himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white, his brow wavered, but
his lofty form towered above Marius as he bowed. Pity on you, sir! It is youth
demanding pity of the old Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1737 man of
ninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it you go to the play, to
balls, to the cafe, to the billiard-hall you have wit, you please the women,
you are a handsome fellow as for me, I spit on my brands in the heart of summer
you are rich with the only riches that are really such, I possess all the
poverty of age infirmity, isolation! You have your thirty-two teeth, a good
digestion, bright eyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black
hair I have no longer even white hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my
legs, I am losing my memory there are three names of streets that I confound
incessantly, the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, that
is what I have come to you have before you the whole future, full of sunshine,
and I am beginning to lose my sight, so far am I advancing into the night you
are in love, that is a matter of course, I am beloved by no one in all the
world and you ask pity of me! Parbleu! Moliere forgot that. If that is the way
you jest at the courthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you.
You are droll. And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice Come,
now, what do you want of me? Sir, said Marius, I know that my presence is
displeasing to you, but I have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I
shall go away immediately. You are a fool! said the old man. Who said that you
were to go away? This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the
bottom of his heart 1738 Les Miserables Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my
neck! M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, that
his harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving him
away he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief and as his grief was
straightway converted into wrath, it increased his harshness. He would have
liked to have Marius understand, and Marius did not understand, which made the
goodman furious. He began again What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you
left my house to go no one knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you
went off, it is easily guessed, to lead a bachelor life its more convenient, to
play the dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself you have given me no
signs of life, you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them,
you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and, at the end of four
years, you come to me, and that is all you have to say to me! This violent
fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive only of silence on
the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms a gesture which with him
was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized Marius bitterly Let us make an end
of this. You have come to ask something of me, you say? Well, what? What is it?
Speak! Sir, said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling
over a precipice, I have come to ask your permission to marry. M. Gillenormand
rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1739 Call my daughter. A second later, the door was opened once more,
Mademoiselle Gillenormand did not enter, but showed herself Marius was
standing, mute, with pendant arms and the face of a criminal M. Gillenormand
was pacing back and forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said to
her Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes to
marry. Thats all. Go away. The curt, hoarse sound of the old mans voice
announced a strange degree of excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a
frightened air, hardly appeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a
syllable to escape her, and disappeared at her fathers breath more swiftly than
a straw before the hurricane. In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned
and placed his back against the chimney-piece once more. You marry! At one and
twenty! You have arranged that! You have only a permission to ask! a formality.
Sit down, sir. Well, you have had a revolution since I had the honor to see you
last. The Jacobins got the upper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you
not a Republican since you are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic
makes a good sauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have
you taken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine,
opposite the Rue des Nonamdieres, there is a cannon-ball incrusted in the wall
of the third story of a house with this inscription July 28th, 1830. Go take a
look at that. It produces a good effect. Ah! those friends of yours do pretty
things. By the way, arent they erecting a fountain 1740 Les Miserables in the
place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry? So you want to marry? Whom? Can
one inquire without indiscretion? He paused, and, before Marius had time to
answer, he added violently Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How
much do you earn at your trade of lawyer? Nothing, said Marius, with a sort of
firmness and resolution that was almost fierce. Nothing? Then all that you have
to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that I allow you? Marius did not
reply. M. Gillenormand continued Then I understand the girl is rich? As rich as
I am. What! No dowry? No. Expectations? I think not. Utterly naked! Whats the
father? I dont know. And whats her name? Mademoiselle Fauchelevent. Fauchewhat?
Fauchelevent. Pttt! ejaculated the old gentleman. Sir! exclaimed Marius. M.
Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself
Thats right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, Free eBooks at Planet

will go and purchase a couple of sous worth of parsley from the fruiterer. Sir,
repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was vanishing, I
entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with clasped hands, sir, I
throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry her! The old man burst into a
shout of strident and mournful laughter, coughing and laughing at the same
time. Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself Pardine! Ill go hunt up that old blockhead,
that absurd numskull! What a shame that Im not twenty-five! How Id treat him to
a nice respectful summons! How nicely Id get along without him! Its nothing to
me, Id say to him Youre only too happy to see me, you old idiot, I want to
marry, I desire to wed Mamselle No-matter-whom, daughter of Monsieur
No-matter-what, I have no shoes, she has no chemise, that just suits I want to
throw my career, my future, my youth, my life to the dogs I wish to take a
plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck, thats an idea, and you
must consent to it! and the old fossil will consent. Go, my lad, do as you
like, attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your Coupelevent
Never, sir, never! Father Never! At the tone in which that never was uttered,
Marius lost all hope. He traversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed
head, tottering and more like a dying man than like one merely taking his
departure. M. Gillenormand followed 1742 Les Miserables him with his eyes, and
at the moment when the door opened, and Marius was on the point of going out,
he advanced four paces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old
gentlemen, seized Marius by the collar, brought him back energetically into the
room, flung him into an armchair and said to him Tell me all about it! It was
that single word father which had effected this revolution. Marius stared at
him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormands mobile face was no longer expressive of
anything but rough and ineffable good-nature. The grandsire had given way before
the grandfather. Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs,
jabber, tell me everything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are! Father
repeated Marius. The old mans entire countenance lighted up with indescribable
radiance. Yes, thats right, call me father, and youll see! There was now
something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and so paternal in this
brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition from discouragement to hope,
was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it were. He was seated near the table,
the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume, which
Father Gillenormand regarded with amazement. Well, father said Marius. Ah, by
the way, interrupted M. Gillenormand, you really Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1743 have not a penny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket. He rummaged in a
drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table Here are a hundred
louis, buy yourself a hat. Father, pursued Marius, my good father, if you only
knew! I love her. You cannot imagine it the first time I saw her was at the
Luxembourg, she came there in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her,
and then, I dont know how it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! how
unhappy that made me! Now, at last, I see her every day, at her own home, her
father does not know it, just fancy, they are going away, it is in the garden
that we meet, in the evening, her father means to take her to England, then I
said to myself Ill go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair.
I should go mad first, I should die, I should fall ill, I should throw myself
into the water. I absolutely must marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.
This is the whole truth, and I do not think that I have omitted anything. She
lives in a garden with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the
neighborhood of the Invalides. Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a
beaming countenance, beside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the
sound of his voice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At
the words Rue Plumet he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of
his snuff to fall upon his knees. The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you
say?Let us see!Are there not barracks in that vicinity?Why, yes, thats it. Your
cousin Theodule has spoken to me about it. The 1744 Les Miserables lancer, the
officer. A gay girl, my good friend, a gay girl! Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet.
It is what used to be called the Rue Blomet.It all comes back to me now. I have
heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In a garden, a
Pamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be a very tidy creature. Between
ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit. I
dont know where he did it. However, thats not to the purpose. Besides, he is
not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I think it quite proper that a young man
like you should be in love. Its the right thing at your age. I like you better
as a lover than as a Jacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat,
sapristi! with twenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I
will do myself the justice to say, that in the line of sans-culottes, I have
never loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce! Theres
no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you without her
fathers knowledge. Thats in the established order of things. I have had
adventures of that same sort myself. More than one. Do you know what is done
then? One does not take the matter ferociously one does not precipitate himself
into the tragic one does not make ones mind to marriage and M. le Maire with
his scarf. One simply behaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense.
Slip along, mortals dont marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a
good-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an
old drawer you say to him See here, grandfather. And the grandfather says Thats
a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have
been young, you will be old. Come, my Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1745 boy,
you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. Amuse
yourself, deuce take it! Nothing better! Thats the way the affair should be
treated. You dont marry, but that does no harm. You understand me? Marius,
petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign with his head that
he did not. The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a
slap on the knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming
air, and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder Booby! make
her your mistress. Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his
grandfather had just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the
barracks, the lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing
of all that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good man
was wandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in words which Marius
did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette. Those words, make
her your mistress, entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword. He
rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the door with a
firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply to his grandfather,
raised his head erect again, and said Five years ago you insulted my father
to-day you have insulted my wife. I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell.
Father Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended his arms,
tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closed once more, and
Marius had 1746 Les Miserables disappeared. The old man remained for several
minutes motionless and as though struck by lightning, without the power to
speak or breathe, as though a clenched fist grasped his throat. At last he tore
himself from his arm-chair, ran, so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the
door, opened it, and cried Help! Help! His daughter made her appearance, then
the domestics. He began again, with a pitiful rattle Run after him! Bring him
back! What have I done to him? He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my
God! This time he will not come back! He went to the window which looked out on
the street, threw it open with his aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than
half-way, while Basque and Nicolette held him behind, and shouted Marius!
Marius! Marius! Marius! But Marius could no longer hear him, for at that moment
he was turning the corner of the Rue Saint-Louis. The octogenarian raised his
hands to his temples two or three times with an expression of anguish, recoiled
tottering, and fell back into an arm-chair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless,
with quivering head and lips which moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his
eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something
which resembled night. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1747 BOOK NINTH.WHITHER
ARE THEY GOING? 1748 Les Miserables CHAPTER I JEAN VALJEAN That same day,
towards four oclock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean was sitting alone on the
back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the Champ-de-Mars. Either from
prudence, or from a desire to meditate, or simply in consequence of one of
those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the
existence of every one, he now rarely went out with Cosette. He had on his
workmans waistcoat, and trousers of gray linen and his long-visored cap
concealed his countenance. He was calm and happy now beside Cosette that which
had, for a time, alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last
week or two, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking on
the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thenardier thanks to his disguise,
Thenardier had not recognized him but since that day, Jean Valjean had seen him
repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thenardier was prowling about in their
neighborhood. This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1749 Moreover, Paris was not tranquil political
troubles presented this inconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to
conceal in his life, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious,
and that while seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they might very
readily discover a man like Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had made up his mind to
quit Paris, and even France, and go over to England. He had warned Cosette. He
wished to set out before the end of the week. He had seated himself on the
slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over all sorts of thoughts in his
mind,Thenardier, the police, the journey, and the difficulty of procuring a
passport. He was troubled from all these points of view. Last of all, an
inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention, and from
which he had not yet recovered, had added to his state of alarm. On the morning
of that very day, when he alone of the household was stirring, while strolling
in the garden before Cosettes shutters were open, he had suddenly perceived on
the wall, the following line, engraved, probably with a nail 16 Rue de la
Verrerie. This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar
were white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the
fine, fresh plaster. This had probably been written on the preceding night.
What was this? A signal for others? A warning for him- 1750 Les Miserables
self? In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that
strangers had made their way into it. He recalled the odd incidents which had
already alarmed the household. His mind was now filling in this canvas. He took
good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the wall, for fear of
alarming her. In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast
by the sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately
behind him. He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four
fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head. He took the
paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in large characters, with a
pencil MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE. Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet there
was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger
than a child, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of
dust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped
into the moat of the Champde-Mars. Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a
very thoughtful mood. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1751 CHAPTER II MARIUS
Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house with very
little hope, and quitted it with immense despair. However, and those who have
observed the depths of the human heart will understand this, the officer, the
lancer, the ninny, Cousin Theodule, had left no trace in his mind. Not the
slightest. The dramatic poet might, apparently, expect some complications from
this revelation made point-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what
the drama would gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one
believes nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes
everything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth has none of
them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over Candide. Suspect
Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius could sooner have committed. He
began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer. He thought
of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two oclock in the morning
he returned to Courfeyracs quarters and flung himself, without 1752 Les
Miserables undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining brightly when he
sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in
the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre
standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out. Courfeyrac
said to him Are you coming to General Lamarques funeral? It seemed to him that
Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese. He went out some time after them. He put in
his pocket the pistols which Javert had given him at the time of the adventure
on the 3d of February, and which had remained in his hands. These pistols were
still loaded. It would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his
mind when he took them with him. All day long he prowled about, without knowing
where he was going it rained at times, he did not perceive it for his dinner,
he purchased a penny roll at a bakers, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It
appears that he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are
moments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passing through
one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything this step he had taken
since the preceding evening. He waited for night with feverish impatience, he
had but one idea clearly before his mindthis was, that at nine oclock he should
see Cosette. This last happiness now constituted his whole future after that,
gloom. At intervals, as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it
seemed to him that he heard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1753 head out of his revery and said Is there fighting on
hand? At nightfall, at nine oclock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, he was
in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot everything. It was
forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette he was about to behold her once
more every other thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and
unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this
sovereign and wonderful property, that at the moment when they are passing they
fill the heart completely. Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into
the garden. Cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He
traversed the thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps She
is waiting for me there, said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his eyes,
and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the tour of the
garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house, and, rendered
senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified, exasperated with grief and
uneasiness, like a master who returns home at an evil hour, he tapped on the
shutters. He knocked and knocked again, at the risk of seeing the window open,
and her fathers gloomy face make its appearance, and demand What do you want?
This was nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he
had rapped, he lifted up his voice and called Cosette.Cosette! he cried
Cosette! he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was over. No one in
the garden no one in the house. Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal
house, 1754 Les Miserables which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far
more empty. He gazed at the stone seat on which he had passed so many adorable
hours with Cosette. Then he seated himself on the flight of steps, his heart
filled with sweetness and resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his
thought, and he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there
was left for him was to die. All at once he heard a voice which seemed to
proceed from the street, and which was calling to him through the trees Mr.
Marius! He started to his feet. Hey? said he. Mr. Marius, are you there? Yes.
Mr. Marius, went on the voice, your friends are waiting for you at the
barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie. This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to
him. It resembled the hoarse, rough voice of Eponine. Marius hastened to the
gate, thrust aside the movable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and
saw some one who appeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into
the gloom. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1755 CHAPTER III M. MABEUF Jean
Valjeans purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his venerable,
infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars he had not admitted
that a star could coin itself into louis dor. He had not divined that what had
fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche. He had taken the purse to the police
commissioner of the quarter, as a lost article placed by the finder at the
disposal of claimants. The purse was actually lost. It is unnecessary to say
that no one claimed it, and that it did not succor M. Mabeuf. Moreover, M.
Mabeuf had continued his downward course. His experiments on indigo had been no
more successful in the Jardin des Plantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The
year before he had owed his housekeepers wages now, as we have seen, he owed
three quarters of his rent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his Flora after
the expiration of thirteen months. Some coppersmith had made stewpans of them.
His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies
of his Flora which were in his possession, he had disposed of the text, at a
mis- 1756 Les Miserables erable price, as waste paper, to a second-hand
bookseller. Nothing now remained to him of his lifes work. He set to work to
eat up the money for these copies. When he saw that this wretched resource was
becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste.
Before this, a long time before, he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of
beef which he ate from time to time. He dined on bread and potatoes. He had
sold the last of his furniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, his
clothing and his blankets, then his herbariums and prints but he still retained
his most precious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among
others, Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible, edition of 1560 La Concordance
des Bibles, by Pierre de Besse Les Marguerites de la Marguerite, of Jean de La
Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre the book de la Charge et
Dignite de lAmbassadeur, by the Sieur de Villiers Hotman a Florilegium
Rabbinicum of 1644 a Tibullus of 1567, with this magnificent inscription
Venetiis, in aedibus Manutianis and lastly, a Diogenes Laertius, printed at
Lyons in 1644, which contained the famous variant of the manuscript 411,
thirteenth century, of the Vatican, and those of the two manuscripts of Venice,
393 and 394, consulted with such fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all
the passages in Doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript
of the twelfth century belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any
fire in his chamber, and went to bed at sundown, in order not to consume any
candles. It seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors people avoided him
when he went out he perceived Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1757 the fact.
The wretchedness of a child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man
interests a young girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is,
of all distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost his
childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his
books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which was a unique
copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he
had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable. One day, Mother Plutarque said
to him I have no money to buy any dinner. What she called dinner was a loaf of
bread and four or five potatoes. On credit? suggested M. Mabeuf. You know well
that people refuse me. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all
his books, one after another, as a father obliged to decimate his children
would gaze upon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it in
under his arm and went out. He returned two hours later, without anything under
his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said You will get something for
dinner. From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which was
never more lifted, descend over the old mans candid face. On the following day,
on the day after, and on the day after that, it had to be done again. M. Mabeuf
went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the second-hand dealers
perceived that he was 1758 Les Miserables forced to sell, they purchased of him
for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs, sometimes at those
very shops. Volume by volume, the whole library went the same road. He said at
times But I am eighty as though he cherished some secret hope that he should
arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books. His
melancholy increased. Once, however, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a
Robert Estienne, which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai
Malaquais, and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in
the Rue des Gres.I owe five sous, he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That
day he had no dinner. He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution
became known there. The president of the society came to see him, promised to
speak to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did so.Why,
what! exclaimed the Minister, I should think so! An old savant! a botanist! an
inoffensive man! Something must be done for him! On the following day, M.
Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the Minister. Trembling with joy, he
showed the letter to Mother Plutarque. We are saved! said he. On the day
appointed, he went to the Ministers house. He perceived that his ragged cravat,
his long, square coat, and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke
to him, not even the Minister. About ten oclock in the evening, while he was
still waiting for a word, he heard the Ministers wife, a beautiful woman in a
low-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach, inquire Who is that old
gentleman? He returned home on foot at midnight, Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1759 in a driving rain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay for a
carriage in which to go thither. He had acquired the habit of reading a few
pages in his Diogenes Laertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew
enough Greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now
no other enjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell
ill. There is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at
the bakers and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecarys.
One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion. And the malady was
growing worse a nurse was required. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase there was
nothing there. The last volume had taken its departure. All that was left to
him was Diogenes Laertius. He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out.
It was the 4th of June, 1832 he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royals
successor, and returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-franc
pieces on the old serving-womans nightstand, and returned to his chamber
without saying a word. On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on
the overturned post in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,
sitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes vaguely
fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals the old man did not
seem to perceive the fact. In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in
Paris. They resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude. Father Mabeuf
raised his head. He saw a gardener 1760 Les Miserables passing, and inquired
What is it? The gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone
It is the riots. What riots? Yes, they are fighting. Why are they fighting? Ah,
good Heavens! ejaculated the gardener. In what direction? went on M. Mabeuf. In
the neighborhood of the Arsenal. Father Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat,
mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm, found none, said Ah!
truly! and went off with a bewildered air. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1761
BOOK TENTH.THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832 1762 Les Miserables CHAPTER I THE SURFACE OF
THE QUESTION Of what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of an
electricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly darting forth, of
a wandering force, of a passing breath. This breath encounters heads which
speak, brains which dream, souls which suffer, passions which burn,
wretchedness which howls, and bears them away. Whither? At random. Athwart the
state, the laws, athwart prosperity and the insolence of others. Irritated
convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations, instincts of war
which have been repressed, youthful courage which has been exalted, generous
blindness curiosity, the taste for change, the thirst for the unexpected, the
sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new
play, and love, the prompters whistle, at the theatre the vague hatreds,
rancors, disappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted
it discomfort, empty dreams, am- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1763 bitious
that are hedged about, whoever hopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at
the very bottom, the rabble, that mud which catches fire, such are the elements
of revolt. That which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl
outside of all bounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants, vagabonds of
the cross-roads, those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other
roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who, each day, demand their bread
from chance and not from toil, the unknown of poverty and nothingness, the
bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong to revolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a
secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state, of life or of
fate, is ripe for riot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to
quiver, and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind. Revolt is a sort of
waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions
of temperature, and which, as it eddies about, mounts, descends, thunders,
tears, razes, crushes, demolishes, uproots, bearing with it great natures and
small, the strong man and the feeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of
straw. Woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It
breaks the one against the other. It communicates to those whom it seizes an
indescribable and extraordinary power. It fills the first-comer with the force
of events it converts everything into projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of a
rough stone, and a general of a porter. If we are to believe certain oracles of
crafty political 1764 Les Miserables views, a little revolt is desirable from
the point of view of power. System revolt strengthens those governments which
it does not overthrow. It puts the army to the test it consecrates the
bourgeoisie, it draws out the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force
of the social framework. It is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene.
Power is in better health after a revolt, as a man is after a good rubbing
down. Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.
There is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself good sense Philintus
against Alcestis mediation offered between the false and the true explanation,
admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, because it is mingled with blame
and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and is often only pedantry. A whole political
school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this. As between cold
water and hot water, it is the lukewarm water party. This school with its false
depth, all on the surface, which dissects effects without going back to first
causes, chides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation of the public
square. If we listen to this school, The riots which complicated the affair of
1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The Revolution of
July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky. They made the
cloudy sky reappear. They caused that revolution, at first so remarkable for
its unanimity, to degenerate into a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in
all progress accomplished by fits and starts, there had been secret fractures
these riots rendered Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1765 them perceptible. It
might have been said Ah! this is broken. After the Revolution of July, one was
sensible only of deliverance after the riots, one was conscious of a
catastrophe. All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the
Exchange into consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitates
failures no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public credit shaken,
industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount, fear everywhere
counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has been calculated that the
first day of a riot costs France twenty millions, the second day forty, the
third sixty, a three days uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions, that
is to say, if only the financial result be taken into consideration, it is
equivalent to a disaster, a shipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate
a fleet of sixty ships of the line. No doubt, historically, uprisings have
their beauty the war of the pavements is no less grandiose, and no less
pathetic, than the war of thickets in the one there is the soul of forests, in
the other the heart of cities the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.
Revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the
Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students proving that
bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard invincible, bivouacs of
shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins, contempt of death on the part of
passers-by. Schools and legions clashed together. After all, between the
combatants, there was only a difference of age the race is the same 1766 Les
Miserables it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for their
ideas, at forty for their families. The army, always a sad thing in civil wars,
opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while proving popular intrepidity,
also educated the courage of the bourgeois. This is well. But is all this worth
the bloodshed? And to the bloodshed add the future darkness, progress
compromised, uneasiness among the best men, honest liberals in despair, foreign
absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand, the
vanquished of 1830 triumphing and saying We told you so! Add Paris enlarged,
possibly, but France most assuredly diminished. Add, for all must needs be
told, the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown
ferocious over liberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have been disastrous.
Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie, that
approximation to the people, so willingly contents itself. For our parts, we
reject this word uprisings as too large, and consequently as too convenient. We
make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement.
We do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle,
in the first place? Here the question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge
than an uprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? And
what if the revolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? The
establishment of Philip V. in Spain cost France two milliards. Even at the same
price, we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we reject these figures, which
appear Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1767 to be reasons and which are only
words. An uprising being given, we examine it by itself. In all that is said by
the doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question of anything
but effect, we seek the cause. We will be explicit. 1768 Les Miserables CHAPTER
II THE ROOT OF THE MATTER There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is
such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in
the wrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones which
are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the
whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort
to arms. In all questions which result from collective sovereignty, the war of
the whole against the fraction is insurrection the attack of the fraction
against the whole is revolt according as the Tuileries contain a king or the
Convention, they are justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed
against the populace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of
Vendemiaire. Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality the Swiss
defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That which universal suffrage has
effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street.
It is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization the instinct of the

doing for Asia with the sword that which Christopher Columbus is doing for
America with the compass Alexander like Columbus, is finding a world. These
gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light, that all
resistance in that case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits
fidelity to itself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for
example, anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in
contraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on
the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne,
turns into chouannerie, and, from having been an insurrection against, becomes
an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance! The contraband salt dealer
escapes the royal gibbets, and with a ropes end round his neck, mounts the
white cockade. Death to the salt duties, brings forth, Long live the King! The

Cadenettes, the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of Brassard, behold an
uprising. La Vendee is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right in
movement is recognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of
excited masses there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do not
give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorances is quite
another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what direction you are
going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may grow great. There is no
insurrection except in a forward direction. Any other sort of rising is bad
every violent step towards the rear is a revolt to retreat is to commit a deed
of violence against the human race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part
of truth the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of
right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against
Louis XIV. is insurrection Hebert against Danton is revolt. Hence it results
that if insurrection in given cases may be, as Lafayette says, the most holy of
duties, an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes. There is also a difference
in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano, revolt is often only
a fire of straw. Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in
power. Polignac is a rioter Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers.
Insurrection is sometimes resurrection. The solution of everything by universal
suffrage being an absolutely modern fact, and all history anterior to this Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1771 fact being, for the space of four thousand
years, filled with violated right, and the suffering of peoples, each epoch of
history brings with it that protest of which it is capable. Under the Caesars,
there was no insurrection, but there was Juvenal. The facit indignatio replaces
the Gracchi. Under the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene there is also the
man of the Annales. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on his
part also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal
world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on Rome-Nineveh, on
Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection of the Apocalypse. John on
his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him, he is a Jew, and
it is Hebrew but the man who writes the Annales is of the Latin race, let us
rather say he is a Roman. As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be
painted to match. The work of the graving-tool alone would be too pale there
must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites. Despots count
for something in the question of philosophers. A word that is chained is a
terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed
on a nation by its master. From this silence there arises a certain mysterious
plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze. The
compression of history produces conciseness in the historian. The granite
solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation
effected by the tyrant. 1772 Les Miserables Tyranny constrains the writer to
conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force. The Ciceronian period,
which hardly sufficed for Verres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less spread
of sail in the phrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all
his might. The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth,
overwhelms as with lightning. Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not
historically superposed upon Caesar. The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar
and Tacitus are two successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be
mysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the stage,
regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great, Tacitus is great God
spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another.
The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, might strike too hard and be
unjust. God does not will it. The great wars of Africa and Spain, the pirates
of Sicily destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into
Germany,all this glory covers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of
the divine justice, hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the
formidable historian, sparing Caesar Tacitus, and according extenuating
circumstances to genius. Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the
despot of genius. There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the
moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such reigns, nothing
veils the shame and those who make examples, Tacitus as well as Juvenal, slap
this ignominy which cannot reply, in the face, more usefully Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1773 in the presence of all humanity. Rome smells worse under
Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius and under Domitian, there is a
deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant. The
villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot a miasma exhales from
these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are
unclean hearts are small consciences are dull, souls are like vermin thus it is
under Caracalla, thus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus,
while, from the Roman Senate, under Caesar, there comes nothing but the odor of
the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles. Hence the advent,
apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals it is in the hour for
evidence, that the demonstrator makes his appearance. But Juvenal and Tacitus,
like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante in the Middle Ages, is man riot and
insurrection are the multitude, which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.
In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact insurrection is
always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello insurrection, Spartacus.
Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the stomach Gaster grows irritated but
Gaster, assuredly, is not always in the wrong. In questions of famine, riot,
Buzancais, for example, holds a true, pathetic, and just point of departure.
Nevertheless, it remains a riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was
wrong in form. Shy although in the right, violent although strong, it struck at
random it walked like a blind elephant it left be- 1774 Les Miserables hind it
the corpses of old men, of women, and of children it wished the blood of
inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment of the
people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means. All armed protests,
even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th of August, even that of July
14th, begin with the same troubles. Before the right gets set free, there is
foam and tumult. In the beginning, the insurrection is a riot, just as a river
is a torrent. Ordinarily it ends in that ocean revolution. Sometimes, however,
coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice,
wisdom, reason, right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall
from rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and
increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph, insurrection
is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a swamp. All this is of
the past, the future is another thing. Universal suffrage has this admirable
property, that it dissolves riot in its inception, and, by giving the vote to
insurrection, it deprives it of its arms. The disappearance of wars, of street
wars as well as of wars on the frontiers, such is the inevitable progression.
Whatever To-day may be, To-morrow will be peace. However, insurrection, riot,
and points of difference between the former and the latter,the bourgeois,
properly speaking, knows nothing of such shades. In his mind, all is sedition,
rebellion pure and simple, the revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt
to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping,
until Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1775 such day as the head of the dog,
suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion.
Then the bourgeois shouts Long live the people! This explanation given, what
does the movement of June, 1832, signify, so far as history is concerned? Is it
a revolt? Is it an insurrection? It may happen to us, in placing this
formidable event on the stage, to say revolt now and then, but merely to
distinguish superficial facts, and always preserving the distinction between
revolt, the form, and insurrection, the foundation. This movement of 1832 had,
in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction, so much grandeur, that
even those who see in it only an uprising, never refer to it otherwise than
with respect. For them, it is like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say
they, are not to be calmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It
must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like
a mountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura, nor
Pyrenees without the Asturias. This pathetic crisis of contemporary history
which the memory of Parisians calls the epoch of the riots, is certainly a
characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before
we enter on the recital. The facts which we are about to relate belong to that
dramatic and living reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of
time and space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation,
human tremor. Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so to
speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance of his- 1776
Les Miserables tory. The epoch, surnamed of the riots, abounds in details of
this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have not sounded
the depths, for another reason than history. We shall therefore bring to light,
among the known and published peculiarities, things which have not heretofore
been known, about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some, and
the death of others. The majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have
disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what
we shall relate, we shall be able to say We have seen this. We alter a few
names, for history relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we
shall paint will be genuine. In accordance with the conditions of the book
which we are now writing, we shall show only one side and one episode, and
certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and the 6th of
June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a
glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of the real form
of this frightful public adventure. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1777
CHAPTER III A BURIAL AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN In the spring of 1832,
although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and
had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris
had already long been ripe for commotion. As we have said, the great city
resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to
fall, and the shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of
General Lamarque. Lamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in
succession, under the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery
requisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the bravery
of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was
discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after upholding the
command, he upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left,
beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future, beloved of
the populace because he had served the Emperor well he was, in company with
1778 Les Miserables Comtes Gerard and Drouet, one of Napoleons marshals in
petto. The treaties of 1815 removed him as a personal offence. He hated
Wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude and, for
seventeen years, he majestically preserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying
hardly any attention to intervening events. In his death agony, at his last
hour, he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the
officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word army,
Lamarque uttering the word country. His death, which was expected, was dreaded
by the people as a loss, and by the government as an occasion. This death was
an affliction. Like everything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt.
This is what took place. On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the
5th of June, the day appointed for Lamarques burial, the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine, which the procession was to touch at, assumed a formidable
aspect. This tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors. They armed
themselves as best they might. Joiners carried off door-weights of their
establishment to break down doors. One of them had made himself a dagger of a
stocking-weavers hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump.
Another, who was in a fever to attack, slept wholly dressed for three days. A
carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who asked him Whither are you going? Eh!
well, I have no weapons. What then? Im going to my timber-yard to get my
compasses. What for? I dont know, said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an
expeditious man, accosted some passing ar- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1779
tisans Come here, you! He treated them to ten sous worth of wine and said Have
you work? No. Go to Filspierre, between the Barriere Charonne and the Barriere
Montreuil, and you will find work. At Filspierres they found cartridges and
arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running
from one house to another, to collect their men. At Barthelemys, near the
Barriere du Trone, at Capels, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted
each other with a grave air. They were heard to say Have you your pistol? Under
my blouse. And you? Under my shirt. In the Rue Traversiere, in front of the
Bland workshop, and in the yard of the Maison-Brulee, in front of tool-maker
Berniers, groups whispered together. Among them was observed a certain Mavot,
who never remained more than a week in one shop, as the masters always
discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day. Mavot
was killed on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Menilmontant.
Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, seconded Mavot, and to
the question What is your object? he replied Insurrection. Workmen assembled at
the corner of the Rue de Bercy, waited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary
agent for the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged almost
publicly. On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun,
General Lamarques funeral procession traversed Paris with official military
pomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with draped drums
and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with 1780 Les Miserables their
swords at their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men.
The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurel
branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the
sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical School,
refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German, and Polish flags,
tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort of banner, children waving
green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment,
printers who were recognizable by their paper caps, marching two by two, three
by three, uttering cries, nearly all of them brandishing sticks, some
brandishing sabres, without order and yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous
rout, again a column. Squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair
of pistols in full view, seemed to pass the host in review, and the files
separated before him. On the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of
the trees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men,
women, and children all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng was
passing, and a terrified throng looked on. The Government, on its side, was
taking observations. It observed with its hand on its sword. Four squadrons of
carabineers could be seen in the Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their
trumpets at their head, cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in
readiness to march in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the
Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street at the Halle-auxVins, a
squadron of dragoons at the Greve half of the 12th Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1781 Light Infantry, the other half being at the Bastille the 6th
Dragoons at the Celestins and the courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery.
The remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks, without reckoning
the regiments of the environs of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over
the menacing multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty
thousand in the banlieue. Divers reports were in circulation in the cortege.
Legitimist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God
had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating
him for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown, announced
that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over, would throw open the
doors of a factory of arms to the people. That which predominated on the
uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with
dejection. Here and there, also, in that multitude given over to such violent
but noble emotions, there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble
mouths which said Let us plunder! There are certain agitations which stir up
the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A
phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers. The procession
proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of the deceased, by way of
the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained from time to time the rain
mattered nothing to that throng. Many incidents, the coffin borne round the
Vendome column, stones thrown at the Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a
balcony with his hat on his 1782 Les Miserables head, the Gallic cock torn from
a popular flag and dragged in the mire, a policeman wounded with a blow from a
sword at the Porte Saint-Martin, an officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying
aloud I am a Republican, the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against
orders to remain at home, the shouts of Long live the Polytechnique! Long live
the Republic! marked the passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille, long
files of curious and formidable people who descended from the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and a certain terrible
seething began to agitate the throng. One man was heard to say to another Do
you see that fellow with a red beard, hes the one who will give the word when
we are to fire. It appears that this red beard was present, at another riot,
the Quenisset affair, entrusted with this same function. The hearse passed the
Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached the esplanade of the bridge
of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd, surveyed at that moment with a
birdseye view, would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the
esplanade and whose tail spread out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the
Bastille, and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte SaintMartin. A
circle was traced around the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette
spoke and bade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching and august instant, all
heads uncovered, all hearts beat high. All at once, a man on horseback, clad in
black, made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag, Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1783 others say, with a pike surmounted with a red
liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head. Exelmans quitted the procession.
This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From the
Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors which
resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts went up Lamarque
to the Pantheon! Lafayette to the Town-hall! Some young men, amid the
declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves and began to drag Lamarque in
the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz and Lafayette in a hackney-coach
along the Quai Morland. In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it
was noticed that a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a
centenarian afterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who had
fought at Trenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under Lafayette. In the
meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion, and
came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the
Celestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men who were dragging
Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted
The dragoons! The dragoons advanced at a walk, in silence, with their pistols
in their holsters, their swords in their scabbards, their guns slung in their
leather sockets, with an air of gloomy expectation. They halted two hundred
paces from the little bridge. The carriage in which sat Lafayette advanced to
them, their ranks opened and allowed it to pass, and then closed behind 1784
Les Miserables it. At that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched. The women
fled in terror. What took place during that fatal minute? No one can say. It is
the dark moment when two clouds come together. Some declare that a blast of
trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the Arsenal others
that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that
three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed Cholet, chief of the
squadron, the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her
window, the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed They are
beginning too soon! and all at once, a squadron of dragoons which had remained
in the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared
swords, through the Rue Bassompierre and the Boulevard Bourdon, sweeping all
before them. Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a
fusillade breaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank,
and pass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of the
Isle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with combatants, stakes
are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young men who are
thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run, and the
municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply their swords, the
crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of
Paris, men shout To arms! they run, tumble down, flee, resist. Wrath spreads
abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1785
CHAPTER IV THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS Nothing is more extraordinary than
the first breaking out of a riot. Everything bursts forth everywhere at once.
Was it foreseen? Yes. Was it prepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements.
Whence falls it? From the clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a
plot there of an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current of the throng
and leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which is mingled
a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are closed, the
displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people flee blows
from gun-stocks beat against portes cocheres, servants can be heard laughing in
the courtyards of houses and saying Theres going to be a row! A quarter of an
hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different
spots in Paris at once. In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young
men, bearded and with long hair, entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment
later, carrying a horizontal tricolored 1786 Les Miserables flag covered with
crape, and having at their head three men armed, one with a sword, one with a
gun, and the third with a pike. In the Rue des Nonaindieres, a very
well-dressed bourgeois, who had a prominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald
head, a lofty brow, a black beard, and one of these stiff mustaches which will
not lie flat, offered cartridges publicly to passers-by. In the Rue
Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about a black flag, on
which could be read in white letters this inscription Republic or Death! In the
Rue des Jeuneurs, Rue du Cadran, Rue Montorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared
waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters, the word section
with a number. One of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible
stripe of white between. They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard
Saint-Martin, and three armorers shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the
second in the Rue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few
minutes, the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred
and thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, and
eighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took the gun, the
other the bayonet. Opposite the Quai de la Greve, young men armed with muskets
installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. One
of them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about making cartridges.
One of these women relates I did not know what cartridges were Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1787 it was my husband who told me. One cluster broke into a
curiosity shop in the Rue des Vielles Haudriettes, and seized yataghans and
Turkish arms. The body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the
Rue de la Perle. And then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on
the boulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, panting
men, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations and shouted To
arms! broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages, unpaved the streets, broke
in the doors of houses, uprooted trees, rummaged cellars, rolled out hogsheads,
heaped up paving-stones, rough slabs, furniture and planks, and made
barricades. They forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered the
dwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and guns of their
absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting The arms have been
delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guns and swords and said
Send for them to-morrow at the Mayors office. They disarmed isolated sentinels
and National Guardsmen in the streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore the
epaulets from officers. In the Rue du Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas, an officer of
the National Guard, on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils,
took refuge with difficulty in a house, whence he was only able to emerge at
nightfall and in disguise. In the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed
out of their hotels and ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe 1788 Les Miserables to
the Cafe du Progress, or descended to the Cafe des SeptBillards, in the Rue des
Mathurins. There, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stone
corner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard in the Rue
Transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades. On a single point the
inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye and the Rue Simon-Le-Franc,
where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands. At a single point the
insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after
having fired on a detachment of the National Guard, and fled through the Rue de
la Corderie. The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, a package of
cartridges, and three hundred pistol-balls. The National Guardsmen tore up the
flag, and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets. All
that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at
all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult, like a mass of tongues of
lightning in one clap of thunder. In less than an hour, twenty-seven barricades
sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the Halles alone. In the centre was
that famous house No. 50, which was the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred
companions, and which, flanked on the one hand by a barricade at SaintMerry,
and on the other by a barricade of the Rue Maubuee, commanded three streets,
the Rue des Arcis, the Rue SaintMartin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which it
faced. The barricades at right angles fell back, the one of the Rue Montorgueil
on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye.
Without reck- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1789 oning innumerable barricades
in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Genevieve one
in the Rue Menilmontant, where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges
another near the little bridge of the HotelDieu made with an ecossais, which
had been unharnessed and overthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of
Police. At the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers, a well-dressed man
distributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat, a
horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the
commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver. Here,
said he, this is to pay expenses, wine, et caetera. A lighthaired young man,
without a cravat, went from barricade to barricade, carrying pass-words.
Another, with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placed sentinels.
In the interior, beyond the barricades, the wine-shops and porters lodges were
converted into guard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most
scientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of
angles and turns, were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the Halles, in
particular, a network of streets more intricate than a forest. The Society of
the Friends of the People had, it was said, undertaken to direct the
insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man killed in the Rue du Ponceau
who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris. That which had really undertaken
the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in
the air. The insurrection had abruptly built barricades with 1790 Les
Miserables one hand, and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the
garrison. In less than three hours, like a train of powder catching fire, the
insurgents had invaded and occupied, on the right bank, the Arsenal, the
Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the whole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms
manufactory, la Galiote, the Chateau-dEau, and all the streets near the Halles
on the left bank, the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pelagie, the Place
Maubert, the powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five
oclock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the Lingerie, of the
Blancs-Manteaux their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires, and menaced
the Bank, the Petits-Peres barracks, and the Post-Office. A third of Paris was
in the hands of the rioters. The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at
all points and, as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers
shops hastily invaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing
of stones was continued with gun-shots. About six oclock in the evening, the
Passage du Saumon became the field of battle. The uprising was at one end, the
troops were at the other. They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a
dreamer, the author of this book, who had gone to get a near view of this
volcano, found himself in the passage between the two fires. All that he had to
protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half-columns which
separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an
hour. Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1791 Guard armed in haste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities,
the regiments from their barracks. Opposite the passage de lAncre a drummer
received a blow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by
thirty young men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword. Another was
killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue-Michelle-Comte, three
officers fell dead one after the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, on being
wounded, in the Rue des Lombards, retreated. In front of the Cour-Batave, a
detachment of National Guards found a red flag bearing the following
inscription Republican revolution, No. 127. Was this a revolution, in fact? The
insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable, tortuous,
colossal citadel. There was the hearth there, evidently, was the question. All
the rest was nothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided there
lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet. In some
regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to the fearful uncertainty
of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovation which had greeted the
neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830. Two intrepid men, tried in
great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General Bugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud
under Lobau. Enormous patrols, composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in
entire companies of the National Guard, and preceded by a commissary of police
wearing his scarf of office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The
insurgents, on their side, placed vi- 1792 Les Miserables dettes at the corners
of all open spaces, and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades.
Each side was watching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand,
hesitated the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to
make itself heard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, who had
seen Austerlitz, regarded this with a gloomy air. These old sailors, accustomed
to correct manoeuvres and having as resource and guide only tactics, that
compass of battles, are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense
foam which is called public wrath. The National Guards of the suburbs rushed up
in haste and disorder. A battalion of the 12th Light came at a run from
Saint-Denis, the 14th of the Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the
Military School had taken up their position on the Carrousel cannons were
descending from Vincennes. Solitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis
Philippe was perfectly serene. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1793 CHAPTER V
ORIGINALITY OF PARIS During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had
witnessed more than one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly
calm than the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the
rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything,it is
only a riot,and Paris has so many affairs on hand, that she does not put
herself out for so small a matter. These colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles.
These immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an
odd and indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences,
when the shop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, he
contents himself with the remark There appears to be a squabble in the Rue
Saint-Martin. Or In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Often he adds carelessly Or
somewhere in that direction. Later on, when the heart-rending and mournful
hubbub 1794 Les Miserables of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible,
the shopkeeper says Its getting hot! Hullo, its getting hot! A moment later,
the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up his shop precipitately,
hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, he places his merchandise in safety
and risks his own person. Men fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley
they take and re-take the barricade blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the
fronts of the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber the
streets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be heard in the
cafes. The theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh
and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war.
Hackney-carriages go their way passers-by are going to a dinner somewhere in
town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on. In 1831, a
fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass. At the time of the
insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a little, infirm old man, pushing
a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored rag, in which he had carafes filled with
some sort of liquid, went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to
the barricade, offering his glasses of cocoa impartially,now to the Government,
now to anarchy. Nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of
uprisings in Paris, which cannot be found in any Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1795 other capital. To this end, two things are requisite, the size
of Paris and its gayety. The city of Voltaire and Napoleon is necessary. On
this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 25th, 1832, the great
city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. It was afraid.
Closed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in the most
distant and most disinterested quarters. The courageous took to arms, the
poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared. Many streets were
empty at four oclock in the morning. Alarming details were hawked about, fatal
news was disseminated, that they were masters of the Bankthat there were six
hundred of them in the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled
in the church that the line was not to be depended on that Armand Carrel had
been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said Get a regiment first
that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them, nevertheless I am with
you. I will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on
ones guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in
the deserted corners of Paris there the imagination of the police, that Anne
Radcliffe mixed up with the Government was recognizable that a battery had been
established in the Rue Aubry le Boucher that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting
their heads together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four
columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the first
coming from the Bastille, the second from the Porte 1796 Les Miserables
Saint-Martin, the third from the Greve, the fourth from the Halles that
perhaps, also, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the
Champ-de-Mars that no one knew what would happen, but that this time, it
certainly was serious. People busied themselves over Marshal Soults hesitations.
Why did not he attack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed.
The old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom. Evening came,
the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation
passers-by were searched suspicious persons were arrested. By nine oclock, more
than eight hundred persons had been arrested, the Prefecture of Police was
encumbered with them, so was the Conciergerie, so was La Force. At the
Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the Rue de Paris was
littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners, whom the man
of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly. All that straw rustled by all these
men, produced the sound of a heavy shower. Elsewhere prisoners slept in the
open air in the meadows, piled on top of each other. Anxiety reigned
everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitual with Paris. People
barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was
to be heard but this Ah! my God! He has not come home! There was hardly even
the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard. People listened on their
thresholds, to the rumors, the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1797 shouts, the
tumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were said It is
cavalry, or Those are the caissons galloping, to the trumpets, the drums, the
firing, and, above all, to that lamentable alarm peal from Saint-Merry. They
waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of the streets
and disappeared, shouting Go home! And people made haste to bolt their doors.
They said How will all this end? From moment to moment, in proportion as the
darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the
formidable flaming of the revolt. 1798 Les Miserables BOOK ELEVENTH.THE ATOM
FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1799 CHAPTER I
SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHES POETRY. THE INFLUENCE
OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY At the instant when the insurrection, arising
from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the Arsenal,
started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was
following the hearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards,
weighed, so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful
ebb. The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made their
escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great
river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, overflowed to right
and 1800 Les Miserables left, and spread in torrents over two hundred streets
at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose. At that moment, a
ragged child who was coming down through the Rue Menilmontant, holding in his
hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights
of Belleville, caught sight of an old holsterpistol in the show-window of a
bric-a-brac merchants shop. Mother Whats-your-name, Im going to borrow your
machine. And off he ran with the pistol. Two minutes later, a flood of
frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse,
encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing La nuit on ne voit rien,
Le jour on voit tres bien, Dun ecrit apocrypha Le bourgeois sebouriffe,
Pratiquez la vertu, Tutu, chapeau pointu! At night one sees nothing, by day one
sees very well the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl, practice
virtue, tutu, pointed hat! It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars. On
the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1801 Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his
march, and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We
know not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well up in all
the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his own chirpings.
An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and
the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory
of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous to his
own. He had, it appears, been for three months apprenticed to a printer. He had
one day executed a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche
was a gamin of letters. Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that
when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that
villainously rainy night, it was to his own brothers that he had played the
part of Providence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning that
is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets at daybreak,
he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically extracted from it
the two brats, had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had
invented, and had then gone away, confiding them to that good mother, the
street, who had brought him up, almost entirely. On leaving them, he had
appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening, and had left them this
discourse by way of a farewell I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my
stick, or, as they say at the court, I file off. If you dont find papa and
mamma, young uns, come back here this evening. 1802 Les Miserables Ill scramble
you up some supper, and Ill give you a shakedown. The two children, picked up
by some policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank, or
having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, did not
return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost
traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since
that night. More than once he had scratched the back of his head and said Where
the devil are my two children? In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand,
in the Rue du Pont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in
that street, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a pastry-cooks shop.
This presented a providential occasion to eat another apple-turnover before
entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in his fob, turned his pocket
inside out, found nothing, not even a sou, and began to shout Help! It is hard
to miss the last cake. Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way. Two minutes
later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing the Rue du Parc-Royal, he
felt called upon to make good the loss of the apple-turnover which had been
impossible, and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the
theatre posters in broad daylight. A little further on, on catching sight of a
group of comfortable-looking persons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he
shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of
philosophical bile as they passed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1803 How fat
those moneyed men are! Theyre drunk! They just wallow in good dinners. Ask em
what they do with their money. They dont know. They eat it, thats what they do!
As much as their bellies will hold. 1804 Les Miserables CHAPTER II GAVROCHE ON
THE MARCH The brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in ones hand in the
open street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his fervor
increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise which he was
singing, he shouted All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, Im all
broken up with rheumatism, but Im satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois
have to do is to bear themselves well, Ill sneeze them out subversive couplets.
What are the police spies? Dogs. And Id just like to have one of them at the
end of my pistol. Im just from the boulevard, my friends. Its getting hot
there, its getting into a little boil, its simmering. Its time to skim the pot.
Forward march, men! Let an impure blood inundate the furrows! I give my days to
my country, I shall never see my concubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But
never mind! Long live joy! Lets fight, crebleu! Ive had enough of despotism. At
that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1805 Guard having fallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement,
and picked up the man, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he
picked up his pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace
and silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast with the
vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway. Scotland has
trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags and the Thou shalt
be King could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour
Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr. The croak would be almost
identical. The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their
own concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-picker
with her basket on her back. All four of them seemed to be standing at the four
corners of old age, which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness. The
rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the rag-picker who salutes
and the portress who patronizes. This is caused by the corner for refuse, which
is fat or lean, according to the will of the portresses, and after the fancy of
the one who makes the heap. There may be kindness in the broom. This rag-picker
was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what a smile! on the three
portresses. Things of this nature were said Ah, by the way, is your cat still
cross? 1806 Les Miserables Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of
dogs, you know. Its the dogs who complain. And people also. But the fleas from
a cat dont go after people. Thats not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I
remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it
in the newspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great
sheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you remember the
King of Rome? I liked the Duc de Bordeau better. I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer
Louis XVIII. Meat is awfully dear, isnt it, Mother Patagon? Ah! dont mention
it, the butchers shop is a horror. A horrible horrorone cant afford anything
but the poor cuts nowadays. Here the rag-picker interposed Ladies, business is
dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one throws anything away any more.
They eat everything. There are poorer people than you, la Vargouleme. Ah, thats
true, replied the rag-picker, with deference, I have a profession. A pause
succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity for boasting which
lies at the bottom of man, added In the morning, on my return home, I pick over
my basket, I sort my things. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a
basket, the cores and stalks in a bucket, the lin- Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1807 en in my cupboard, the woollen stuff in my commode, the old
papers in the corner of the window, the things that are good to eat in my bowl,
the bits of glass in my fireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones
under my bed. Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening. Old ladies,
said he, what do you mean by talking politics? He was assailed by a broadside,
composed of a quadruple howl. Heres another rascal. Whats that hes got in his
paddle? A pistol? Well, Id like to know what sort of a beggars brat this is?
That sort of animal is never easy unless hes overturning the authorities.
Gavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, with elevating the
tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide. The rag-picker cried
You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch! The one who answered to the name of
Patagon clapped her hands together in horror. Theres going to be evil doings,
thats certain. The errand-boy next door has a little pointed beard, I have seen
him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm to-day I saw
him pass, and he had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there
was a revolution atatatwheres the calf!at Pontoise. And then, there you see
him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems 1808 Les Miserables that the
Celestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government can do with
good-for-nothings who dont know how to do anything but contrive ways of
upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a little quiet after all the
misfortunes that have happened, good Lord! to that poor queen whom I saw pass
in the tumbril! And all this is going to make tobacco dearer. Its infamous! And
I shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine, the wretch! Youve
got the sniffles, old lady, said Gavroche. Blow your promontory. And he passed on.
When he was in the Rue Pavee, the rag-picker occurred to his mind, and he
indulged in this soliloquy Youre in the wrong to insult the revolutionists,
Mother Dust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. Its so that you may
have more good things to eat in your basket. All at once, he heard a shout
behind him it was the portress Patagon who had followed him, and who was
shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying Youre nothing but a bastard.
Oh! Come now, said Gavroche, I dont care a brass farthing for that! Shortly
afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered this appeal Forward
march to the battle! And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at
his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1809 Im going off, said he, but you wont go off! One
dog may distract the attention from another dog. 45 A very gaunt poodle came
along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him. 45 Chien, dog, trigger.
My poor doggy, said he, you must have gone and swallowed a cask, for all the
hoops are visible. Then he directed his course towards lOrme-Saint-Gervais.
1810 Les Miserables CHAPTER III JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER The worthy
hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom
Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in
his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under
the Empire. They were talking. The hairdresser had, naturally, spoken to the
veteran of the riot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had
passed to the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and
soldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with
arabesques, and which he would have entitled Dialogue between the razor and the
sword. How did the Emperor ride, sir? said the barber. Badly. He did not know
how to fallso he never fell. Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine
horses! On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a
racing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle deep, a
fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly articulated
knees, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1811 prominent ribs, oblique shoulders
and a powerful crupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height. A pretty
horse, remarked the hair-dresser. It was His Majestys beast. The hair-dresser
felt, that after this observation, a short silence would be fitting, so he
conformed himself to it, and then went on The Emperor was never wounded but
once, was he, sir? The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of
a man who had been there In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well
dressed as on that day. He was as neat as a new sou. And you, Mr. Veteran, you
must have been often wounded? I? said the soldier, ah! not to amount to
anything. At Marengo, I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a
bullet in the right arm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland,
a thrust from a bayonet, there,at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts, no
matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers. Ah!
and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaien in the thigh, thats all. How fine
that is! exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, to die on the field
of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed, of an illness, slowly,
a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms, syringes, medicines, I should
prefer to receive a cannon-ball in my belly! Youre not over fastidious, said
the soldier. He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the 1812 Les
Miserables shop. The show-window had suddenly been fractured. The wig-maker
turned pale. Ah, good God! he exclaimed, its one of them! What? A cannon-ball.
Here it is, said the soldier. And he picked up something that was rolling about
the floor. It was a pebble. The hair-dresser ran to the broken window and
beheld Gavroche fleeing at the full speed, towards the Marche Saint-Jean. As he
passed the hair-dressers shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his
mind, had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and had
flung a stone through his panes. You see! shrieked the hair-dresser, who from
white had turned blue, that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure
pleasure of it. What has any one done to that gamin? Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1813 CHAPTER IV THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN In the meantime,
in the Marche Saint-Jean, where the post had already been disarmed, Gavroche
had just effected a junction with a band led by Enjolras, Courfeyrac,
Combeferre, and Feuilly. They were armed after a fashion. Bahorel and Jean
Prouvaire had found them and swelled the group. Enjolras had a double-barrelled
hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun of a National Guard bearing the number of his
legion, and in his belt, two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be
seen, Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle Courfeyrac was
brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in his hand,
marched at their head shouting Long live Poland! They reached the Quai Morland.
Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked by the rain, with lightning in their
eyes. Gavroche accosted them calmly Where are we going? Come along, said
Courfeyrac. Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, 1814 Les
Miserables who was like a fish in water in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat,
and indulged in the sort of words which break everything. His waistcoat
astounded a passer-by, who cried in bewilderment Here are the reds! The reds,
the reds! retorted Bahorel. A queer kind of fear, bourgeois. For my part I dont
tremble before a poppy, the little red hat inspires me with no alarm. Take my
advice, bourgeois, lets leave fear of the red to horned cattle. He caught sight
of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of
paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a Lenten admonition addressed by
the Archbishop of Paris to his flock. Bahorel exclaimed Flock a polite way of
saying geese. And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche.
From that instant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel. Bahorel, observed
Enjolras, you are wrong. You should have let that charge alone, he is not the
person with whom we have to deal, you are wasting your wrath to no purpose.
Take care of your supply. One does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any
more than with a gun. Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras, retorted Bahorel.
This bishops prose shocks me I want to eat eggs without being permitted. Your
style is the hot and cold I am amusing myself. Besides, Im not wasting myself,
Im getting a start and if I tore down that charge, Hercle! twas only to whet my
appetite. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1815 This word, Hercle, struck
Gavroche. He sought all occasions for learning, and that tearer-down of posters
possessed his esteem. He inquired of him What does Hercle mean? Bahorel
answered It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin. Here Bahorel recognized at a
window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they
passed, probably a Friend of the A B C. He shouted to him Quick, cartridges,
para bellum. A fine man! thats true, said Gavroche, who now understood Latin. A
tumultuous retinue accompanied them,students, artists, young men affiliated to
the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, armed with clubs and bayonets
some, like Combeferre, with pistols thrust into their trousers. An old man, who
appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band. He had no arms, and he
made great haste, so that he might not be left behind, although he had a
thoughtful air. Gavroche caught sight of him Keksekca? said he to Courfeyrac.
Hes an old duffer. It was M. Mabeuf. 1816 Les Miserables CHAPTER V THE OLD MAN
Let us recount what had taken place. Enjolras and his friends had been on the
Boulevard Bourdon, near the public storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons
had made their charge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre were among those
who had taken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting To the barricades! In the Rue
Lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along. What had attracted their
attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though he were
intoxicated. Moreover, he had his hat in his hand, although it had been raining
all the morning, and was raining pretty briskly at the very time. Courfeyrac
had recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him through having many times accompanied
Marius as far as his door. As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than
timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of
him in the midst of that uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry charges,
almost in the midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, and strolling about
among the bullets, he had accosted him, and the following dialogue had been
exchanged between the rioter of fire and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1817
the octogenarian M. Mabeuf, go to your home. Why? Theres going to be a row.
Thats well. Thrusts with the sword and firing, M. Mabeuf. That is well. Firing
from cannon. That is good. Where are the rest of you going? We are going to
fling the government to the earth. That is good. And he had set out to follow
them. From that moment forth he had not uttered a word. His step had suddenly
become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of
the head. He advanced nearly to the front rank of the column, with the movement
of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping. What a
fierce old fellow! muttered the students. The rumor spread through the troop
that he was a former member of the Convention, an old regicide. The mob had
turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie. Little Gavroche marched in front with
that deafening song which made of him a sort of trumpet. He sang Voici la lune
qui paratt, Quand irons-nous dans la foret? Demandait Charlot a Charlotte. 1818

one God, one King, one half-farthing, and one boot. And these two poor little
wolves were as tipsy as sparrows from having drunk dew and thyme very early in
the morning. And these two poor little things were as drunk as thrushes in a
vineyard a tiger laughed at them in his cave. The one cursed, the other swore.
When shall we go to the forest? Charlot asked Charlotte. They directed their
course towards Saint-Merry. 1820 Les Miserables CHAPTER VI RECRUITS The band
augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of lofty stature,
whose hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daring mien was remarked by Courfeyrac,
Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whom none of them knew, joined them. Gavroche,
who was occupied in singing, whistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding
on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol paid no
attention to this man. It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed
in front of Courfeyracs door. This happens just right, said Courfeyrac, I have
forgotten my purse, and I have lost my hat. He quitted the mob and ran up to
his quarters at full speed. He seized an old hat and his purse. He also seized
a large square coffer, of the dimensions of a large valise, which was concealed
under his soiled linen. As he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him
Monsieur de Courfeyrac! Whats your name, portress? Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1821 The portress stood bewildered. Why, you know perfectly well, Im
the concierge my name is Mother Veuvain. Well, if you call me Monsieur de
Courfeyrac again, I shall call you Mother de Veuvain. Now speak, whats the
matter? What do you want? There is some one who wants to speak with you. Who is
it? I dont know. Where is he? In my lodge. The devil! ejaculated Courfeyrac.
But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour, said the
portress. At the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthful
artisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet, and
who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man, emerged from
the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the
world like a womans voice Monsieur Marius, if you please. He is not here. Will
he return this evening? I know nothing about it. And Courfeyrac added For my
part, I shall not return. The young man gazed steadily at him and said Why not?
Because. 1822 Les Miserables Where are you going, then? What business is that
of yours? Would you like to have me carry your coffer for you? I am going to
the barricades. Would you like to have me go with you? If you like! replied
Courfeyrac. The street is free, the pavements belong to every one. And he made
his escape at a run to join his friends. When he had rejoined them, he gave the
coffer to one of them to carry. It was only a quarter of an hour after this
that he saw the young man, who had actually followed them. A mob does not go
precisely where it intends. We have explained that a gust of wind carries it
away. They overshot Saint-Merry and found themselves, without precisely knowing
how, in the Rue Saint-Denis. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1823 BOOK TWELFTH.
CORINTHE 1824 Les Miserables CHAPTER I HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION
The Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end near the
Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, a basket-makers shop
having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon the Great with this
inscription NAPOLEON IS MADE WHOLLY OF WILLOW, have no suspicion of the
terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago. It was
there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds spell
Chanverrerie, and the celebrated publichouse called Corinthe. The reader will
remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point, and
eclipsed, by the way, by the barricade Saint-Merry. It was on this famous
barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, now fallen into profound Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1825 obscurity, that we are about to shed a little light. May
we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital, to the
simple means which we have already employed in the case of Waterloo. Persons
who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution
of the houses which stood at that epoch near the Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the
northeast angle of the Halles of Paris, where to-day lies the embouchure of the
Rue Rambuteau, have only to imagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its
summit and the Halles with its base, and whose two vertical bars should form
the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose
transverse bar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue
Mondetour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles. So that
the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form, on a space
three fathoms square, between the Halles and the Rue Saint-Denis on the one
hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue des Precheurs on the other,
seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise and
hap-hazard, and barely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow
crannies. We say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those
dark, contracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings. These
buildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue de la
PetiteTruanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house
to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad, the pedestrian there
walked on a pavement 1826 Les Miserables that was always wet, skirting little
stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops, excessive heaps
of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century-old gratings. The Rue
Rambuteau has devastated all that. The name of Mondetour paints marvellously
well the sinuosities of that whole set of streets. A little further on, they
are found still better expressed by the Rue Pirouette, which ran into the Rue
Mondetour. The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue SaintDenis in the Rue
de la Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had
entered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very short,
he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles by a tall row of
houses, and he would have thought himself in a blind alley, had he not
perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his
escape. This was the Rue Mondetour, which on one side ran into the Rue de
Precheurs, and on the other into the Rue du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At
the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the
right, there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and
which formed a sort of cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories
only, that an illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred
years before. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old
Theophilus described in the following couplet La branle le squelette horrible
Dun pauvre amant qui se pendit. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1827 There swings
the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself. The situation was good,
and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there, from father to son. In the time
of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the Pot-aux-Roses, and as the
rebus was then in fashion, it had for its sign-board, a post poteau painted
rose-color. In the last century, the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic
masters nowadays despised by the stiff school, having got drunk many times in
this wine-shop at the very table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted,
by way of gratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of
the cabaret, in his joy, had changed his device and had caused to be placed in
gilt letters beneath the bunch these words At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes Au
Raisin de Corinthe. Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothing is more natural to
drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe
gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses. The last proprietor of the dynasty,
Father Hucheloup, no longer acquainted even with the tradition, had the post
painted blue. A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on
the first floor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase piercing
the ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broad
daylight,this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with a trap-door in
the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor were the lodgings of the
Hucheloup family. They were reached by a 1828 Les Miserables staircase which
was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entrance only a private
door in the large room on the first floor. Under the roof, in two mansard
attics, were the nests for the servants. The kitchen shared the groundfloor
with the tap-room. Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the
fact is that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone
in his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital thing
which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps, which he called
carpes au gras. These were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp
of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu
of table-cloths. People came thither from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine
morning, had seen fit to notify passers-by of this specialty he had dipped a
brush in a pot of black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own
account, as well as a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall
this remarkable inscription CARPES HO GRAS. One winter, the rain-storms and the
showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the S which terminated the first word,
and the G which began the third this is what remained CARPE HO RAS. Time and
rain assisting, a humble gastronomical an- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1829
nouncement had become a profound piece of advice. In this way it came about,
that though he knew no French, Father Hucheloup understood Latin, that he had
evoked philosophy from his kitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent,
he had equalled Horace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also
meant Enter my wine-shop. Nothing of all this is in existence now. The
Mondetour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably
no longer exists at the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe
have disappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau. As we have already
said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the rallying-point, of Courfeyrac
and his friends. It was Grantaire who had discovered Corinthe. He had entered
it on account of the Carpe horas, and had returned thither on account of the
Carpes au gras. There they drank, there they ate, there they shouted they did
not pay much, they paid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always
welcome. Father Hucheloup was a jovial host. Hucheloup, that amiable man, as
was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper with a mustache an amusing variety. He
always had an ill-tempered air, seemed to wish to intimidate his customers,
grumbled at the people who entered his establishment, and had rather the mien
of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we
insist upon the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had
attracted customers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to each
other Come hear Father 1830 Les Miserables Hucheloup growl. He had been a
fencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big voice, a
good fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior, he asked
nothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff-boxes which are
in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze. Mother Hucheloup,
his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature. About 1830, Father Hucheloup
died. With him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps. His inconsolable widow
continued to keep the wine-shop. But the cooking deteriorated, and became
execrable the wine, which had always been bad, became fearfully bad.
Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to Corinthe, out of
pity, as Bossuet said. The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and
given to rustic recollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her
pronunciation. She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced her
reminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly been her
delight, so she affirmed, to hear the loups-de-gorge rouges-gorges chanter dans
les ogrepines aubepinesto hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees. The
hall on the first floor, where the restaurant was situated, was a large and
long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and tables, and with a
crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached by a spiral staircase which
terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a
ship. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1831 This room, lighted by a single
narrow window, and by a lamp that was always burning, had the air of a garret.
All the four-footed furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs
the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in
honor of Mame Hucheloup Elle etonne a dix pas, elle epouvente a deux, Une
verrue habite en son nez hasardeux On tremble a chaque instant quelle ne vous la
mouche Et quun beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche. She astounds at ten
paces, she frightens at two, a wart inhabits her hazardous nose you tremble
every instant lest she should blow it at you, and lest, some fine day, her nose
should tumble into her mouth. This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall. Mame
Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till night before this
quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two serving-maids, named Matelote
and Gibelotte,49 and who had never been known by any other names, helped Mame
Hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine, and the various broths
which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large,
plump, redhaired, and noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup,
was homelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may still, as it
becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was less
homely 1832 Les Miserables than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate,
white with a lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids,
always languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude,
the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even the
other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a vague and
sleepy smile. 49 Matelote a culinary preparation of various fishes. Gibelotte
stewed rabbits. Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the
door the following line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac Regale si tu peux
et mange si tu loses. Treat if you can, and eat if you dare. Free eBooks at

reader knows, lived more with Joly than elsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird
has one on a branch. The two friends lived together, ate together, slept
together. They had everything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They
were, what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, bini. On the
morning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly, who was
all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning to share. Laigles coat
was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed. It was about nine oclock in the
morning, when they opened the door of Corinthe. They ascended to the first
floor. Matelote and Gibelotte received them. Oysters, cheese, and ham, said
Laigle. And they seated themselves at a table. The wine-shop was empty there
was no one there but themselves. Gibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle
of wine on the table. 1834 Les Miserables While they were busy with their first
oysters, a head appeared at the hatchway of the staircase, and a voice said I
am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie cheese. I
enter. It was Grantaire. Grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table. At
the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the table. That
made three. Are you going to drink those two bottles? Laigle inquired of
Grantaire. Grantaire replied All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two
bottles never yet astonished a man. The others had begun by eating, Grantaire
began by drinking. Half a bottle was rapidly gulped down. So you have a hole in
your stomach? began Laigle again. You have one in your elbow, said Grantaire.
And after having emptied his glass, he added Ah, by the way, Laigle of the
funeral oration, your coat is old. I should hope so, retorted Laigle. Thats why
we get on well together, my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does
not bind me anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my
movements, I am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old coats are
just like old friends. Thats true, ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue,
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1835 an old goat is an old abi ami, friend.
Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up, said Grantaire.
Grantaire, demanded Laigle, have you just come from the boulevard? No. We have
just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I. Its a marvellous sight,
said Joly. How quiet this street is! exclaimed Laigle. Who would suspect that
Paris was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that in former days
there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood! Du Breul and Sauval
give a list of them, and so does the Abbe Lebeuf. They were all round here,
they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted, shaven, bearded, gray, black,
white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins, Carmelites, Little Augustines, Great
Augustines, old Augustinesthere was no end of them. Dont lets talk of monks,
interrupted Grantaire, it makes one want to scratch ones self. Then he
exclaimed Bouh! Ive just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is taking
possession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly. I hate
the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in front of the big
public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is called a library is
disgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink! What scrawling! And all that
has been written! What rascal was it who said that man was a featherless
biped?51 And then, 1836 Les Miserables I met a pretty girl of my acquaintance,
who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be called Floreal, and who is
delighted, enraptured, as happy as the angels, because a wretch yesterday, a
frightful banker all spotted with smallpox, deigned to take a fancy to her!
Alas! woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats
chase mice as well as birds. Two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an
attic, she adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do
you call it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of flowers,
she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. This transformation took place
last night. I met the victim this morning in high spirits. The hideous point
about it is, that the jade is as pretty to-day as she was yesterday. Her
financier did not show in her face. Roses have this advantage or disadvantage
over women, that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah!
there is no morality on earth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of
love, the laurel, the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of
peace, the appletree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the
fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what right
is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands what wrong
Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers The wrong that Alba did to you, the
wrong that Fidenae did to you, the wrong that the Eques, the Volsci, and the
Sabines have done to you. They were your neighbors. The Clusians are ours. We
understand neighborliness just as you do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take
Clusium. Rome said You shall not take Clusi- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
1837 um. Brennus took Rome. Then he cried Vae victis! That is what right is.
Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world! What eagles! It makes my flesh
creep. 51 Bipede sans plume biped without featherspen. He held out his glass to
Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went on, having hardly been interrupted
by this glass of wine, of which no one, not even himself, had taken any notice
Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette is an
eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other. So we
believe in nothing. There is but one reality drink. Whatever your opinion may
be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or in favor of the fat
cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little, drink. You talk to me of
the boulevard, of that procession, et caetera, et caetera. Come now, is there
going to be another revolution? This poverty of means on the part of the good
God astounds me. He has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment.
There is a hitch, it wont work. Quick, a revolution! The good God has his hands
perpetually black with that cart-grease. If I were in his place, Id be
perfectly simple about it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, Id
lead the human race in a straightforward way, Id weave matters mesh by mesh,
without breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements, I would
have no extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by
means of two motors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time, the
exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neither for event
nor 1838 Les Miserables for men among men geniuses are required, among events
revolutions. Great accidents are the law the order of things cannot do without
them and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would be tempted to think
that Heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance. At the moment when
one expects it the least, God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament.
Some queer star turns up, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the
death of Caesar. Brutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a
comet. Crac, and behold an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great
man 93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head of the
poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes!
Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is in
disorder, the star as well as the drama. Good God, it is too much and not
enough. These resources, gathered from exception, seem magnificence and
poverty. My friends, Providence has come down to expedients. What does a
revolution prove? That God is in a quandry. He effects a coup detat because he,
God, has not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in my
conjectures as to Jehovahs fortune and when I see so much distress in heaven
and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a
hundred thousand livres of income, when I see human destiny, which is very
badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witness the Prince de
Conde hung, when I see winter, which is nothing but a rent in the zenith
through which the wind blows, when I see so many rags even in the perfectly new
purple Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1839 of the morning on the crests of
hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost,
that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and so many
spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so much misery
everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearance exists, it is true,
but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money-box
is empty gives a ball. God must not be judged from appearances. Beneath the
gilding of heaven I perceive a poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt.
That is why I am discontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night
ever since this morning I have been waiting for daylight to come it has not
come, and I bet that it wont come all day. This is the inexactness of an
ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anything else,
this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition, everything
goes awry the universe is a tease. Its like children, those who want them have
none, and those who dont want them have them. Total Im vexed. Besides, Laigle
de Meaux, that bald-head, offends my sight. It humiliates me to think that I am
of the same age as that baldy. However, I criticise, but I do not insult. The
universe is what it is. I speak here without evil intent and to ease my
conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, the assurance of my distinguished
consideration. Ah! by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of
paradise, I was not intended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound
forever, like a shuttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the
loungers to the group of the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watch- 1840
Les Miserables ing oriental houris all day long, executing those exquisite
Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man, or a Beauceron
peasant, or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman, or a petty German
prince, furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation,
and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to
say, his frontier. Those are the positions for which I was born! Yes, I have
said a Turk, and I will not retract. I do not understand how people can
habitually take Turks in bad part Mohammed had his good points respect for the
inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques! Let us not
insult Mohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost!
Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great piece of stupidity. And it
appears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles, and to break each
others profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer, in the month
of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm, to breathe the
immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit
altogether too many follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a
bric-a-brac merchants suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten
the human race. Yes, behold me sad again. Thats what comes of swallowing an
oyster and a revolution the wrong way! I am growing melancholy once more. Oh!
frightful old world. People strive, turn each other out, prostitute themselves,
kill each other, and get used to it! And Grantaire, after this fit of
eloquence, had a fit of coughing, which was well earned. Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1841 A propos of revolution, said Joly, it is decidedly abberent that
Barius is in lub. Does any one know with whom? demanded Laigle. Do. No? Do! I
tell you. Marius love affairs! exclaimed Grantaire. I can imagine it. Marius is
a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of poets. He who
says poet, says fool, madman, Tymbraeus Apollo. Marius and his Marie, or his
Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must make a queer pair of lovers. I
know just what it is like. Ecstasies in which they forget to kiss. Pure on
earth, but joined in heaven. They are souls possessed of senses. They lie among
the stars. Grantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his second
harangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs.
It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small, yellow, with an
odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain, and
wearing a contented air. The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the
three, addressed himself to Laigle de Meaux. Are you Monsieur Bossuet? That is
my nickname, replied Laigle. What do you want with me? This. A tall blonde
fellow on the boulevard said to me Do you know Mother Hucheloup? I said Yes,
Rue Chanvrerie, the old mans widow he said to me Go there. There you will find
M. Bossuet. Tell him from me A B C. Its 1842 Les Miserables a joke that theyre
playing on you, isnt it. He gave me ten sous. Joly, lend me ten sous, said
Laigle and, turning to Grantaire Grantaire, lend me ten sous. This made twenty
sous, which Laigle handed to the lad. Thank you, sir, said the urchin. What is
your name? inquired Laigle. Navet, Gavroches friend. Stay with us, said Laigle.
Breakfast with us, said Grantaire, The child replied I cant, I belong in the
procession, Im the one to shout Down with Polignac! And executing a prolonged
scrape of his foot behind him, which is the most respectful of all possible
salutes, he took his departure. The child gone, Grantaire took the word That is
the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of the gamin species. The
notarys gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cooks gamin is called a scullion,
the bakers gamin is called a mitron, the lackeys gamin is called a groom, the
marine gamin is called the cabin-boy, the soldiers gamin is called the
drummer-boy, the painters gamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesmans gamin
is called an errand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly
gamin is called the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino. In the
meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1843 A B C, that is to say the burial of Lamarque. The tall
blonde, remarked Grantaire, is Enjolras, who is sending you a warning. Shall we
go? ejaculated Bossuet. Its raiding, said Joly. I have sworn to go through
fire, but not through water. I dont wand to ged a gold. I shall stay here, said
Grantaire. I prefer a breakfast to a hearse. Conclusion we remain, said Laigle.
Well, then, let us drink. Besides, we might miss the funeral without missing
the riot. Ah! the riot, I am with you! cried Joly. Laigle rubbed his hands. Now
were going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter of fact, it does
hurt the people along the seams. I dont think much of your revolution, said
Grantaire. I dont execrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the
cotton night-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think that
to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his royalty in
two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people,
and open the umbrella end against heaven. The room was dark, large clouds had
just finished the extinction of daylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or
in the street, every one having gone off to watch events. Is it mid-day or
midnight? cried Bossuet. You cant see your hand before your face. Gibelotte,
fetch a light. Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way. Enjolras disdains
me, he muttered. Enjolras said Joly is 1844 Les Miserables ill, Grantaire is
drunk. It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he had come for me, I would
have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras! I wont go to his funeral.
This resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did not stir from
the wine-shop. By two oclock in the afternoon, the table at which they sat was
covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning on it, one in a flat
copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the other in the neck of a
cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and Bossuet to wine Bossuet and Joly
had conducted Grantaire back towards cheerfulness. As for Grantaire, he had got
beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer of dreams, ever since mid-day. Wine
enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact,
in the matter of inebriety, white magic and black magic wine is only white
magic. Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible
fit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him, attracted him.
He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The beer-glass is the
abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, and being desirous of filling
his brain with twilight, he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy,
stout, absinthe, which produces the most terrible of lethargies. It is of these
three vapors, beer, brandy, and absinthe, that the lead of the soul is
composed. They are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and
there are formed there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing
of the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about
the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1845 slumbering Psyche. Grantaire had not
yet reached that lamentable phase far from it. He was tremendously gay, and
Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked glasses. Grantaire added to the eccentric
accentuation of words and ideas, a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left
fist on his knee with dignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat
untied, seated astride a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled
solemn words at the big maid-servant Matelote Let the doors of the palace be
thrown open! Let every one be a member of the French Academy and have the right
to embrace Madame Hucheloup. Let us drink. And turning to Madame Hucheloup, he
added Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplate
thee! And Joly exclaimed Matelote and Gibelotte, dodt gib Grantaire anything
more to drink. He has already devoured, since this bording, in wild
prodigality, two francs and ninety-five centibes. And Grantaire began again Who
has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting them on the
table in the guise of candles? Bossuet, though very drunk, preserved his
equanimity. He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in
the falling rain, and gazing at his two friends. All at once, he heard a tumult
behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of To arms! He turned round and saw in the
Rue Saint-Denis, at the end of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, En- 1846 Les
Miserables jolras passing, gun in hand, and Gavroche with his pistol, Feuilly
with his sword, Courfeyrac with his sword, and Jean Prouvaire with his
blunderbuss, Combeferre with his gun, Bahorel with his gun, and the whole armed
and stormy rabble which was following them. The Rue de la Chanvrerie was not
more than a gunshot long. Bossuet improvised a speaking-trumpet from his two
hands placed around his mouth, and shouted Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohee!
Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a few paces
into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting What do you want? which crossed a Where
are you going? To make a barricade, replied Courfeyrac. Well, here! This is a
good place! Make it here! Thats true, Aigle, said Courfeyrac. And at a signal
from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Rue de la Chanvrerie. Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1847 CHAPTER III NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON
GRANTAIRE The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street
widened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit.
Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easily barricaded on the
right and the left, no attack was possible except from the Rue SaintDenis, that
is to say, in front, and in full sight. Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of
a fasting Hannibal. Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of
the mob. There was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space
of a flash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,
area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every description
were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified old woman fixed a
mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles for drying linen, in order
to deaden the effect of musketry. The wineshop alone remained open and that for
a very good reason, 1848 Les Miserables that the mob had rushed into it.Ah my
God! Ah my God! sighed Mame Hucheloup. Bossuet had gone down to meet
Courfeyrac. Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed Courfeyrac,
you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatch gold. In the meantime, in
the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated
front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street had been unpaved Gavroche and
Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer
named Anceau this dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed
beneath the piles of paving-stones Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the
widow Hucheloups empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime Feuilly,
with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up
the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone.
Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where. The
beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house-fronts and
laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street
was already barred with a rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the
hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing.
Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and came
loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She served the
barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air. Free eBooks at
Planet eBook.com 1849 An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the
street. Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,
made the passengers alight, offered his hand to the ladies, dismissed the conductor,
and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle. Omnibuses, said
he, do not pass the Corinthe. Non licet omnibus adire Corinthum. An instant
later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will, through the Rue
Mondetour, and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the
street. Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story. Her
eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried in a low
tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat. The end of
the world has come, she muttered. Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloups fat,
red, wrinkled neck, and said to Grantaire My dear fellow, I have always
regarded a womans neck as an infinitely delicate thing. But Grantaire attained
to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote had mounted to the first floor
once more, Grantaire seized her round her waist, and gave vent to long bursts
of laughter at the window. Matelote is homely! he cried Matelote is of a dream
of ugliness! Matelote is a chimaera. This is the secret of her birth a Gothic
Pygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with one of
them, the most horrible, 1850 Les Miserables one fine morning. He besought Love
to give it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She has
chromateof-lead-colored hair, like Titians mistress, and she is a good girl. I
guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl contains a hero. As for
Mother Hucheloup, shes an old warrior. Look at her moustaches! She inherited
them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She will fight too. These two alone
will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow
the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric
acid and formic acid however, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me.
Gentlemen, my father always detested me because I could not understand
mathematics. I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good
fellow. Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and the
result is that I have never lacked it but, if I had been rich, there would have
been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the kind hearts only had
fat purses, how much better things would go! I picture myself Jesus Christ with
Rothschilds fortune! How much good he would do! Matelote, embrace me! You are
voluptuous and timid! You have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and
lips which claim the kiss of a lover. Hold your tongue, you cask! said Courfeyrac.
Grantaire retorted I am the capitoul52 and the master of the floral games! 52
Municipal officer of Toulouse. Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the
barricade, gun in hand, raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, Free
eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1851 as the reader knows, had something of the
Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He would have perished at
Thermopylae with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda with Cromwell. Grantaire, he
shouted, go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here. This is
the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness. Dont disgrace the barricade!
This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would have said
that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. He seemed to be
rendered suddenly sober. He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the
window, looked at Enjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him Let
me sleep here. Go and sleep somewhere else, cried Enjolras. But Grantaire,
still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him, replied Let me sleep
here,until I die. Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes Grantaire, you are
incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, of living, and of dying.
Grantaire replied in a grave tone You will see. He stammered a few more
unintelligible words, then his head fell heavily on the table, and, as is the
usual effect of the second period of inebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly
and abruptly thrust him, an instant later he had fallen asleep. 1852 Les Miserables
CHAPTER IV AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP Bahorel, in ecstasies over
the barricade, shouted Heres the street in its low-necked dress! How well it
looks! Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to
console the widowed proprietress. Mother Hucheloup, werent you complaining the
other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law,
because Gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window? Yes, my good Monsieur
Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you going to put that table of mine in your
horror, too? And it was for the counterpane, and also for a pot of flowers
which fell from the attic window into the street, that the government collected
a fine of a hundred francs. If that isnt an abomination, what is! Well, Mother
Hucheloup, we are avenging you. Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand
very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these repri- Free eBooks
at Planet eBook.com 1853 sals made on her account. She was satisfied after the
manner of that Arab woman, who, having received a box on the ear from her
husband, went to complain to her father, and cried for vengeance, saying
Father, you owe my husband affront for affront. The father asked On which cheek
did you receive the blow? On the left cheek. The father slapped her right cheek
and said Now you are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughters
ears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wifes. The rain had ceased.
Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of
powder, a basket containing bottles of vitriol, two or three carnival torches,
and a basket filled with fire-pots, left over from the Kings festival. This
festival was very recent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that
these munitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pepin.
They smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the lantern
corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all the lanterns in the
surrounding streets, de Mondetour, du Cygne, des Precheurs, and de la Grande
and de la Petite-Truanderie. Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed
everything. Two barricades were now in process of construction at once, both of
them resting on the Corinthe house and forming a right angle the larger shut
off the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondetour, on the side
of the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, was
constructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were about fifty workers on
it thirty were armed with guns 1854 Les Miserables for, on their way, they had
effected a wholesale loan from an armorers shop. Nothing could be more bizarre
and at the same time more motley than this troop. One had a round-jacket, a
cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves, with
a round hat, and a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of
nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddlers awl. There was one who
was shouting Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of
our bayonet. This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the
cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the
cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted Public Order.
There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions, few hats, no
cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, all ages, all sorts of faces,
small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. All were in haste and as they
helped each other, they discussed the possible chances. That they would receive
succor about three oclock in the morningthat they were sure of one regiment,
that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of
cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they did not
know each others names. Great perils have this fine characteristic, that they
bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the
kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs,
spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst
of it all, they drank. Caps and buckshot were mixed Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1855 pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In the
billiardhall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously modified by
terror, which had stupefied one, rendered another breathless, and roused the
third, were tearing up old dish-cloths and making lint three insurgents were
assisting them, three bushy-haired, jolly blades with beards and moustaches,
who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made
them tremble. The man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and
Enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the
Rue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself
useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for the young man who
had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and who had inquired for M.
Marius, he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been
overturned. Gavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to
get everything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted,
whistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement of all. Had
he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty had he wings? yes, certainly, his
joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantly visible, he was incessantly
audible. He filled the air, as he was everywhere at once. He was a sort of
almost irritating ubiquity no halt was possible with him. The enormous
barricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled the loungers, he excited the
idle, he reanimated the weary, he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he
inspired gayety in 1856 Les Miserables some, and breath in others, wrath in
others, movement in all, now pricking a student, now biting an artisan he
alighted, paused, flew off again, hovered over the tumult, and the effort,
sprang from one party to another, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole
company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach. Perpetual motion was in his
little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs. Courage! more
paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are you now? A hod of plaster
for me to stop this hole with! Your barricade is very small. It must be carried
up. Put everything on it, fling everything there, stick it all in. Break down
the house. A barricade is Mother Gibous tea. Hullo, heres a glass door. This
elicited an exclamation from the workers. A glass door? what do you expect us
to do with a glass door, tubercle? Hercules yourselves! retorted Gavroche. A
glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack,
but it prevents the enemy taking it. So youve never prigged apples over a wall
where there were broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National
Guard when they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherous
thing. Well, you havent a very wildly lively imagination, comrades. However, he
was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one to another, demanding
A gun, I want a gun! Why dont you give me a gun? Give you a gun! said
Combeferre. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1857 Come now! said Gavroche, why
not? I had one in 1830 when we had a dispute with Charles X. Enjolras shrugged
his shoulders. When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the
children. Gavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered If you are killed
before me, I shall take yours. Gamin! said Enjolras. Greenhorn! said Gavroche.
A dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created
a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him Come with us, young fellow! well now, dont
we do anything for this old country of ours? The dandy fled. 1858 Les Miserables
CHAPTER V PREPARATIONS The journals of the day which said that that nearly
impregnable structure, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they
call it, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is,
that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It was built in
such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, either disappear behind
it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row
of paving-stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps in the
interior. On the outside, the front of the barricade, composed of piles of
paving-stones and casks bound together by beams and planks, which were
entangled in the wheels of Anceaus dray and of the overturned omnibus, had a
bristling and inextricable aspect. An aperture large enough to allow a man to
pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of
the barricade which was furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was
possible at this point. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up
with ropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the barricade.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1859 The little Mondetour barricade, hidden
behind the wineshop building, was not visible. The two barricades united formed
a veritable redoubt. Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade
the other fragment of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des
Precheurs an issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible
communication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of an attack
through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue des Precheurs. With the
exception of this issue which was left free, and which constituted what Folard
in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into account,
also, the narrow cutting arranged on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of
the barricade, where the wine-shop formed a salient angle, presented an
irregular square, closed on all sides. There existed an interval of twenty
paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the
background of the street, so that one might say that the barricade rested on
these houses, all inhabited, but closed from top to bottom. All this work was
performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour, and without this handful
of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or a single bayonet make their
appearance. The very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter
the Rue Saint-Denis cast a glance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of
the barricade, and redoubled their pace. The two barricades being finished, and
the flag run up, a table was dragged out of the wine-shop and Courfeyrac 1860
Les Miserables mounted on the table. Enjolras brought the square coffer, and
Courfeyrac opened it. This coffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw
the cartridges, a tremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence
ensued. Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile. Each one received thirty
cartridges. Many had powder, and set about making others with the bullets which
they had run. As for the barrel of powder, it stood on a table on one side,
near the door, and was held in reserve. The alarm beat which ran through all
Paris, did not cease, but it had finally come to be nothing more than a
monotonous noise to which they no longer paid any attention. This noise
retreated at times, and again drew near, with melancholy undulations. They
loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with solemn gravity.
Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades, one in the
Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des Precheurs, the third at the
corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie. Then, the barricades having been
built, the posts assigned, the guns loaded, the sentinels stationed, they
waited, alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any
longer, surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human
movement palpitated, enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was
drawing on, in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt
advancing, and which had about it something tragic and terrifying, isolated,
armed, determined, and tranquil. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1861 CHAPTER
VI WAITING During those hours of waiting, what did they do? We must needs tell,
since this is a matter of history. While the men made bullets and the women
lint, while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead, destined to the
bullet-mould smoked over a glowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon
in hand, on the barricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert,
kept an eye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,
Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and united as in
the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life, and, in
one corner of this wine-shop which had been converted into a casement, a couple
of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built, with their carbines
loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs, these fine young
fellows, so close to a supreme hour, began to recite love verses. What verses?

Miserables Nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe Tu masquais la vitre avec un
jupon Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe, Et je te donnais le tasse en japon.
Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire! Ton manchon brule, ton boa
perdu! Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare Quun soir pour souper nons
avons vendu! Jetais mendiant et toi charitable. Je baisais au vol tes bras
frais et ronds. Dante in folio nous servait de table Pour manger gaiment un
cent de marrons. La premiere fois quen mon joyeux bouge Je pris un baiser a ton
levre en feu, Quand tu ten allais decoiffee et rouge, Je restai tout pale et je
crus en Dieu! Te rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre, Et tous ces fichus
changes en chiffons? Oh que de soupirs, de nos coeurs pleins dombre, Se sont
envoles dans les cieux profonds! Do you remember our sweet life, when we were
both so young, and when we had no other desire in our hearts than to be well
dressed and in love? When, by adding your age to my age, we could not count
forty years between us, and when, in Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1865 our
humble and tiny household, everything was spring to us even in winter. Fair
days! Manuel was proud and wise, Paris sat at sacred banquets, Foy launched
thunderbolts, and your corsage had a pin on which I pricked myself. Everything
gazed upon you. A briefless lawyer, when I took you to the Prado to dine, you
were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turn round, and I heard them
say Is she not beautiful! How good she smells! What billowing hair! Beneath her
mantle she hides a wing. Her charming bonnet is hardly unfolded. I wandered
with thee, pressing thy supple arm. The passersby thought that love bewitched
had wedded, in our happy couple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of
May. We lived concealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, that sweet
forbidden fruit. My mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart had already
responded. The Sorbonne was the bucolic spot where I adored thee from eve till
morn. Tis thus that an amorous soul applies the chart of the Tender to the
Latin country. O Place Maubert! O Place Dauphine! When in the fresh spring-like
hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thy delicate leg, I saw a star in the
depths of the garret. I have read a great deal of Plato, but nothing of it
remains by me better than Malebranche and then Lamennais thou didst demonstrate
to me celestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me, I obeyed thee,
thou didst submit to me oh gilded garret! to lace thee! to behold thee going
and coming from dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient
mirror! And who, then, would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the
firmament, of flowers, of gauze and of moire, when love stammers a charming
slang? 1866 Les Miserables Our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips thou didst
mask the window with thy petticoat I took the earthenware bowl and I gave thee
the Japanese cup. And those great misfortunes which made us laugh! Thy cuff
scorched, thy boa lost! And that dear portrait of the divine Shakespeare which
we sold one evening that we might sup! I was a beggar and thou wert charitable.
I kissed thy fresh round arms in haste. A folio Dante served us as a table on
which to eat merrily a centimes worth of chestnuts. The first time that, in my
joyous den, I snatched a kiss from thy fiery lip, when thou wentest forth,
dishevelled and blushing, I turned deathly pale and I believed in God. Dost
thou recall our innumerable joys, and all those fichus changed to rags? Oh!
what sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly
depths! The hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars
which began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those deserted
streets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was in preparation,
gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by
Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentle poet. In the meantime, a
lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and in the large one, one of
those wax torches such as are to be met with on Shrove-Tuesday in front of
vehicles loaded with masks, on their way to la Courtille. These torches, as the
reader has seen, came from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The torch had been
placed in a sort of cage of pavingstones closed on three sides to shelter it
from the wind, and Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1867 disposed in such a
fashion that all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricade
remained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag
formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern. This light enhanced the
scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable and terrible purple. 1868 Les
Miserables CHAPTER VII THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES Night was
fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard was confused
noises, and at intervals, fusillades but these were rare, badly sustained and
distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a sign that the Government
was taking its time, and collecting its forces. These fifty men were waiting
for sixty thousand. Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on
strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of
Gavroche, who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious
light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account of
the powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no gleam
outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have any light in the
upper stories. Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not
precisely with his cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just
entered the tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least
lighted. A musket of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1869 large model had
fallen to his share, and he held it between his legs. Gavroche, who had been,
up to that moment, distracted by a hundred amusing things, had not even seen
this man. When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,
admiring his gun then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street urchin
sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment,
would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the
band of insurgents, with singular attention but, from the moment when he had
entered this room, he had fallen into a sort of brown study, and no longer
seemed to see anything that was going on. The gamin approached this pensive
personage, and began to step around him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity
of a person whom one is afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish
countenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and so
profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man
which signify Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be?
no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched
both fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in a
gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain,
incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in
the slave mart, discovering a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an
amateur recognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work,
the instinct which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evi-
1870 Les Miserables dent that a great event had happened in Gavroches life. It
was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras accosted him.
You are small, said Enjolras, you will not be seen. Go out of the barricade,
slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the streets, and come
back and tell me what is going on. Gavroche raised himself on his haunches. So
the little chaps are good for something! thats very lucky! Ill go! In the
meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big ones. And
Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as he indicated the
man of the Rue des Billettes Do you see that big fellow there? Well? Hes a
police spy. Are you sure of it? It isnt two weeks since he pulled me off the
cornice of the Port Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear. Enjolras
hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a
longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand. The man left the
room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by three others. The four
men, four porters with broad shoulders, went and placed themselves without
doing anything to attract his attention, behind the table on which the man of
the Rue des Billettes was leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to
hurl themselves upon him. Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1871 Who are you? At this abrupt query, the man
started. He plunged his gaze deep into Enjolras clear eyes and appeared to
grasp the latters meaning. He smiled with a smile than which nothing more
disdainful, more energetic, and more resolute could be seen in the world, and
replied with haughty gravity I see what it is. Well, yes! You are a police spy?
I am an agent of the authorities. And your name? Javert. Enjolras made a sign
to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, before Javert had time to turn
round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned and searched. They found on him a
little round card pasted between two pieces of glass, and bearing on one side
the arms of France, engraved, and with this motto Supervision and vigilance,
and on the other this note JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two, and the
signature of the Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet. Besides this, he
had his watch and his purse, which contained several gold pieces. They left him
his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at the bottom of his fob, they felt
and seized a paper in an envelope, which Enjolras unfolded, and on which he
read these five lines, written in the very hand of the Prefect of Police As
soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert will make sure,
by special supervision, whether it 1872 Les Miserables is true that the
malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine, near the
Jena bridge. The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms
behind his back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the
room which had formerly given the wine-shop its name. Gavroche, who had looked
on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss
of his head, stepped up to Javert and said to him Its the mouse who has caught
the cat. All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those
about the wine-shop noticed it. Javert had not uttered a single cry. At the
sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Combeferre, and
the men scattered over the two barricades came running up. Javert, with his
back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement,
raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied. He is
a police spy, said Enjolras. And turning to Javert You will be shot ten minutes
before the barricade is taken. Javert replied in his most imperious tone Why
not at once? We are saving our powder. Then finish the business with a blow
from a knife. Spy, said the handsome Enjolras, we are judges and not assassins.
Then he called Gavroche Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1873 Here you! go about
your business! Do what I told you! Im going! cried Gavroche. And halting as he
was on the point of setting out By the way, you will give me his gun! and he
added I leave you the musician, but I want the clarionet. The gamin made the
military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade.
1874 Les Miserables CHAPTER VIII MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A
CERTAIN LE CABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC The tragic picture which
we have undertaken would not be complete, the reader would not see those grand
moments of social birth-pangs in a revolutionary birth, which contain
convulsion mingled with effort, in their exact and real relief, were we to
omit, in the sketch here outlined, an incident full of epic and savage horror
which occurred almost immediately after Gavroches departure. Mobs, as the
reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they roll along, a throng of
tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other whence they come. Among the
passers-by who had joined the rabble led by Enjolras, Combeferre, and
Courfeyrac, there had been a person Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1875
wearing the jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the
shoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a drunken
savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who was, moreover,
an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him, was very drunk, or
assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated himself with several others
at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while
making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful
air the large house at the extremity of the barricade, whose five stories
commanded the whole street and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he
exclaimed Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must
fire. When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance
into the street! Yes, but the house is closed, said one of the drinkers. Let us
knock! They will not open. Let us break in the door! Le Cabuc runs to the door,
which had a very massive knocker, and knocks. The door opens not. He strikes a
second blow. No one answers. A third stroke. The same silence. Is there any one
here? shouts Cabuc. Nothing stirs. Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter
the door with the butt end. It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow,
solid, entirely of oak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron 1876 Les
Miserables and iron stays, a genuine prison postern. The blows from the butt
end of the gun made the house tremble, but did not shake the door.
Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a tiny,
square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at this aperture
appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired old man, who was the
porter, and who held a candle. The man who was knocking paused. Gentlemen, said
the porter, what do you want? Open! said Cabuc. That cannot be, gentlemen.
Open, nevertheless. Impossible, gentlemen. Le Cabuc took his gun and aimed at
the porter but as he was below, and as it was very dark, the porter did not see
him. Will you open, yes or no? No, gentlemen. Do you say no? I say no, my goo
The porter did not finish. The shot was fired the ball entered under his chin
and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the jugular vein. The
old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and was extinguished, and
nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the
small window, and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof.
There! said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun Free eBooks at Planet
eBook.com 1877 to the pavement. He had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a
hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an eagles talon, and he heard a
voice saying to him On your knees. The murderer turned round and saw before him
Enjolras cold, white face. Enjolras held a pistol in his hand. He had hastened
up at the sound of the discharge. He had seized Cabucs collar, blouse, shirt,
and suspender with his left hand. On your knees! he repeated. And, with an
imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and
sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his knees in the mire. Le Cabuc
attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand.
Enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his womans face, had
about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. His dilated nostrils,
his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek profile that expression of
wrath and that expression of Chastity which, as the ancient world viewed the
matter, befit Justice. The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged
themselves in a circle at a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a
word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold. Le Cabuc,
vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in every limb. 1878 Les
Miserables Enjolras released him and drew out his watch. Collect yourself, said
he. Think or pray. You have one minute. Mercy! murmured the murderer then he
dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths. Enjolras never took
his eyes off of him he allowed a minute to pass, then he replaced his watch in
his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc by the hair, as the latter coiled
himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked, and placed the muzzle of the
pistol to his ear. Many of those intrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered
upon the most terrible of adventures, turned aside their heads. An explosion
was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards. Enjolras
straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe glance around him.
Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said Throw that outside. Three men
raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still agitated by the last
mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled, and flung it over the little
barricade into the Rue Mondetour. Enjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to
say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at
once he raised his voice. A silence fell upon them. Citizens, said Enjolras,
what that man did is frightful, what I have done is horrible. He killed,
therefore I killed him. I had to do it, because insurrection must have its dis-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1879 cipline. Assassination is even more of a
crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the Revolution, we are the
priests of the Republic, we are the victims of duty, and must not be possible
to slander our combat. I have, therefore, tried that man, and condemned him to
death. As for myself, constrained as I am to do what I have done, and yet
abhorring it, I have judged myself also, and you shall soon see to what I have
condemned myself. Those who listened to him shuddered. We will share thy fate,
cried Combeferre. So be it, replied Enjolras. One word more. In executing this
man, I have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world,
necessitys name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monsters shall
disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish before Fraternity.
It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I do pronounce it.
And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I make use of thee, but I
hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will be neither darkness nor
thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance, nor bloody retaliation. As there will
be no more Satan, there will be no more Michael. In the future no one will kill
any one else, the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will love. The
day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life
it will come, and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die.
Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing
on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His staring eye
caused those 1880 Les Miserables about him to speak in low tones. Jean
Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each others hands silently, and, leaning
against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched with an
admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young man,
executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also of rock. Let
us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies were taken to
the morgue and searched, a police agents card was found on Le Cabuc. The author
of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made
to the Prefect of Police in 1832. We will add, that if we are to believe a
tradition of the police, which is strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc
was Claquesous. The fact is, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was
no longer any question of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of
his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible.
His life had been all shadows, his end was night. The whole insurgent group was
still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so
quickly tried and so quickly terminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the
barricade, the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.
This lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join the
insurgents. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1881 BOOK THIRTEENTH. MARIUS ENTERS
THE SHADOW 1882 Les Miserables CHAPTER I FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER
SAINT-DENIS The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the
barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect of the
voice of destiny. He wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked
at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness offered him the key. These
melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair, are tempting.
Marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass, emerged
from the garden, and said I will go. Mad with grief, no longer conscious of
anything fixed or solid in his brain, incapable of accepting anything
thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth
and love, overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair, he had but one
desire remaining, to make a speedy end of all. He set out at rapid pace. He
found himself most oppor- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1883 tunely armed, as
he had Javerts pistols with him. The young man of whom he thought that he had
caught a glimpse, had vanished from his sight in the street. Marius, who had
emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversed the Esplanade and the
bridge of the Invalides, the Champs Elysees, the Place Louis XV., and reached
the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open there, the gas was burning under the
arcades, women were making their purchases in the stalls, people were eating
ices in the Cafe Laiter, and nibbling small cakes at the English pastrycooks
shop. Only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel
des Princes and the Hotel Meurice. Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through
the Passage Delorme. There the shops were closed, the merchants were chatting
in front of their half-open doors, people were walking about, the street
lanterns were lighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were
lighted as usual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal. Marius followed
the Rue Saint-Honore. In proportion as he left the Palais-Royal behind him,
there were fewer lighted windows, the shops were fast shut, no one was chatting
on the thresholds, the street grew sombre, and, at the same time, the crowd
increased in density. For the passers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could
be seen to speak in this throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep
murmur. Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were assemblages, motionless
and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst
of running water. 1884 Les Miserables At the entrance to the Rue des
Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked. It formed a resisting, massive, solid,
compact, almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together, and
conversing in low tones. There were hardly any black coats or round hats now,
but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This
multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the
hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a dull
trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in
the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the Rue
Saint-Honore, there was no longer a single window in which a candle was
burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen
vanishing into the street in the distance. The lanterns of that date resembled
large red stars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a shadow which
had the form of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. There could be
descried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious
observer passed that limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended
and the army began. Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He
had been summoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to
pass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the
sentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Bethisy, and directed his
course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais, there were
no longer any lanterns. After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had
passed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1885 the limits of the troops he found
himself in something startling. There was no longer a passer-by, no longer a
soldier, no longer a light, there was no one solitude, silence, night, I know
not what chill which seized hold upon one. Entering a street was like entering
a cellar. He continued to advance. He took a few steps. Some one passed close
to him at a run. Was it a man? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could
not have told. It had passed and vanished. Proceeding from circuit to circuit,
he reached a lane which he judged to be the Rue de la Poterie near the middle
of this street, he came in contact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It
was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and
paving-stones scattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and
abandoned. He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of
the barrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along the
walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him that he
could make out something white in front of him. He approached, it took on a
form. It was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in
the morning, who had been straying at random all day from street to street, and
had finally halted there, with the weary patience of brutes who no more
understand the actions of men, than man understands the actions of Providence.
Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street which seemed
to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one knows whence, and
traversing 1886 Les Miserables the darkness at random, whistled close by him,
and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his head over a
hairdressers shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in
the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market. This
shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encountered nothing more.
The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps. Nevertheless,
Marius pressed forward. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1887 CHAPTER II AN OWLS
VIEW OF PARIS A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the
wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.
All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city, through
which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand lanes cross,
and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold, would
have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre
of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns,
thanks to the closed windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all
movement ceased.</p>
